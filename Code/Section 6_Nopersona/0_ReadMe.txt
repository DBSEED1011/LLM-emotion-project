This folder contains two data files ('merged_all_models_persona.csv' and 'merged_all_models_nopersona.csv'), four code files ( '1_Descriptive_subplot.Rmd', '1_Descriptive.ipynb',  '2_RSA.ipynb'  and  '3_SHAP.ipynb'), and three completed HTML results ('1_Descriptive.html', '2_RSA.html' and '3_SHAP.html').
For simplicity, other potential output files have been removed, keeping only those necessary for plotting ('shap_results.csv' and 'xgb_oos_performance.csv').

Please first run '1_Descriptive_subplot.Rmd', which generates a series of SVG vector figures beginning with "fig_". Then, run '1_Descriptive.ipynb',   '2_RSA.ipynb'  and  '3_SHAP.ipynb' in sequence.

The three subsequent files correspond to Supplementary Sections 6.1–6.3, respectively.
