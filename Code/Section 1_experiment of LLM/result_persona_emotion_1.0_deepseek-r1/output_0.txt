-40	45	1	-10	65	30.0	20.0	AA_valence = -40, AA_arousal = 45, choice = 1, AC_valence = -10, AC_arousal = 65    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-40):** Seeing Player 1 keep $19 while giving only $11 to Player 2 feels unfair and selfish. My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices vs. societal average of 5) triggers frustration, but my below-average justice sensitivity (27 vs. 32.3 societal avg) tempers extreme negativity.   - **AA_arousal (45):** The blatant inequity spikes my emotional reactivity (total 64 vs. 61.96 avg)—especially intensity (23 vs. 20.99 avg)—causing moderate agitation.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** As a prosocial person (0 competitive/individual choices), I prioritize fairness over personal cost. Paying $3 to zero Player 1’s earnings aligns with my instinct to enforce cooperation, despite no direct gain.   - **AC_valence (-10):** Punishing relieves some frustration (valence rises from -40), but residual discomfort lingers from the unfairness.   - **AC_arousal (65):** The act of punishment heightens arousal—my emotional duration (14 vs. 12.33 avg) prolongs the intensity, and expending energy to "correct" injustice amplifies physiological tension
32	26	0	35	15	3.0	-11.0	AA_valence = 32, AA_arousal = 26, choice = 0, AC_valence = 35, AC_arousal = 15
-15	25	1	35	12	50.0	-13.0	AA_valence = -15, AA_arousal = 25, choice = 1, AC_valence = 35, AC_arousal = 12    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 take **$18** (60%) while giving Player 2 only **$12** (40%) triggers mild frustration. My prosocial personality prioritizes fairness, making this inequality feel unjust. Valence dips slightly negative (-15), with moderate arousal (25) from the perceived unfairness.   - **Choice:** Punishing costs **$0**, making it a zero-cost opportunity to enforce fairness. My justice sensitivity (lower than average) still compels action against clear imbalance. Choosing punishment aligns with my prosocial drive to correct inequity.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** After punishing, satisfaction sets in (valence +35) from upholding fairness. Arousal drops (12) as the tension resolves—knowing Player 1 faces consequences while Player 2 is protected, costing me nothing.    *Note: My depression tendency (low risk) and emotional reactivity (intensity slightly above average) amplify initial discomfort but subside after restorative action.*
-37	61	1	42	53	79.0	-8.0	AA_valence = -37, AA_arousal = 61, choice = 1, AC_valence = 42, AC_arousal = 53    **Reasoning Breakdown:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):**     - *Valence (-37):* Strong disapproval of the unfair allocation (19/11 split instead of 15/15). My prosocial personality (9 prosocial choices) triggers negative feelings toward selfishness.     - *Arousal (61):* High frustration due to heightened emotional sensitivity (subscore 27) and intensity (subscore 23), amplified by witnessing injustice.    - **Choice (Punish):**     - As a prosocial type, I prioritize fairness over personal gain. Low punishment cost ($4) makes rejecting the unfair offer feasible. Justice sensitivity (score 27) demands accountability despite being slightly below average.    - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):**     - *Valence (42):* Satisfaction from enforcing fairness. Depression subscore (10) is low, allowing positive reinforcement from rectifying injustice.     - *Arousal (53):* Residual energy from the act, though calmer than initial outrage. Emotional duration (subscore 14) sustains moderate arousal
-20	35	1	25	10	45.0	-25.0	AA_valence = -20, AA_arousal = 35, choice = 1, AC_valence = 25, AC_arousal = 10    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 keep $16 while giving Player 2 only $14 triggers mild frustration (valence: slightly negative at -20) and moderate arousal (35) due to my prosocial orientation and below-average justice sensitivity heightening discomfort with unfairness.   - **Choice:** Punish (cost=$1). Though technically "close" to fair, the deliberate $1 deviation feels intentionally selfish. My prosocial bias (9 prosocial choices vs. avg 5.15) and low punishment cost justify sacrificing $1 to enforce fairness.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Valence turns positive (+25) from rectifying injustice; arousal drops to 10 (calm satisfaction) after acting on my values without significant personal cost
40	25	0	42	20	2.0	-5.0	AA_valence = 40, AA_arousal = 25, choice = 0, AC_valence = 42, AC_arousal = 20    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (40):** Mildly positive emotion seeing the fair 15/15 split. My prosocial nature appreciates equity, though my below-average justice sensitivity (27 vs societal 32.32) prevents strong excitement.   - **AA_arousal (25):** Low arousal as the routine offer aligns with expectations. My autism subscales show comfort with routine (8) and low imagination (10), reducing surprise.   - **Choice (0):** Accepting is logical. Punishing a fair proposal contradicts my prosocial personality (9 prosocial choices) and wastes $3. My emotional reactivity (64) focuses on intensity (23), but not irrationality.   - **AC_valence (42):** Slight uplift from upholding fairness without conflict. Depression subscales show strong positive affect (5), reinforcing contentment.   - **AC_arousal (20):** Calmer post-decision. Social skills (18) and low depression (26) support confident, low-stress choices.    *Note: Scores reflect profile nuances—e.g., below-average imagination limits emotional range, while low depression supports stability.*
-25	40	1	5	20	30.0	-20.0	AA_valence = -25, AA_arousal = 40, choice = 1, AC_valence = 5, AC_arousal = 20    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-25):** Seeing Player 1 keep $16 while giving only $14 to Player 2 feels deliberately unfair. As a prosocial person, this imbalance triggers mild frustration (negative valence), but not extreme anger since the deviation from perfect fairness ($15/$15) is small.   - **AA_arousal (40):** The unfairness sparks moderate emotional activation (higher arousal) due to my elevated emotional intensity (23 vs. avg 20.99). My lower justice sensitivity (27 vs. avg 32.33) prevents intense outrage.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** With zero cost to punish, I reject this slight exploitation. My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices vs. avg 5) compels me to enforce fairness, denying Player 1’s excess.   - **AC_valence (5):** Post-punishment, valence shifts toward neutral/mildly positive. Removing Player 1’s unfair gain aligns with my values, though residual discomfort lingers from the initial inequity.   - **AC_arousal (20):** Arousal decreases significantly after acting. The decision resolves tension, leveraging my short emotional duration (14 vs. avg 12.33) to return toward calm.    *Note: All values reflect character traits—e.g., high prosocial bias, moderate emotional reactivity, and low depression risk—shaping nuanced emotional responses.*
-35	65	1	12	40	47.0	-25.0	AA_valence = -35, AA_arousal = 65, choice = 1, AC_valence = 12, AC_arousal = 40    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 keep $18 (60%) while giving Player 2 only $12 (40%) triggers frustration. Valence is negative (-35) because this violates prosocial fairness expectations. Arousal is high (65) due to strong emotional reactivity (intensity score 23 > average) and sensitivity to unfairness (justice sensitivity 27).   - **Choice:** Punish (1). As a consistently prosocial person (9/9 prosocial choices historically), allowing unfairness conflicts with my values. The low cost ($1) makes punishment feel necessary to uphold fairness.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Valence improves (12) because punishing restores psychological balance. Arousal remains elevated (40) from residual indignation but is tempered by satisfaction in enforcing justice.    *Note: Emotional shifts align with my profile—high emotional intensity (+23) amplifies reactions, while low depression risk (26) prevents spiraling negativity.*
-40	70	1	60	50	100.0	-20.0	AA_valence = -40, AA_arousal = 70, choice = 1, AC_valence = 60, AC_arousal = 50    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-40):** Seeing Player 1 allocate only $11 to Player 2 (vs. fair $15) triggers frustration due to my prosocial orientation. My above-average emotional intensity (23 vs. 20.99 societal avg) amplifies this negative reaction.   - **AA_arousal (70):** The blatant unfairness causes high arousal—my elevated Routine score (8) clashes with disrupted expectations, and emotional sensitivity (27) fuels this surge.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** My dominant prosocial trait (9 choices vs. 5.15 avg) overrides lower justice sensitivity (27 vs. 32.33). Paying $1 to zero Player 1’s earnings aligns with enforcing fairness despite personal cost.   - **AC_valence (60):** Post-punishment, satisfaction surges from upholding justice—depression scores show low interpersonal conflict tolerance (2 vs. 3 avg), validating assertive action.   - **AC_arousal (50):** Residual energy lingers from enacting justice, moderated by relief. Lower imagination (10 vs. 16.97) simplifies emotional transition to resolution
-30	25	1	10	40	40.0	15.0	AA_valence = -30, AA_arousal = 25, choice = 1, AC_valence = 10, AC_arousal = 40    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-30):** Mildly negative emotion seeing Player 1 take $17 (unfair advantage) while offering Player 2 barely below the fair midpoint ($15).   - **AA_arousal (25):** Moderate frustration at the imbalance, amplified by my prosocial tendency to value equity.   - **Choice (1):** Punish—costs me $0, and my justice sensitivity (even if slightly below average) demands accountability for unfairness. My 100% prosocial experimental history rejects exploitation.   - **AC_valence (10):** Slight relief/satisfaction from enforcing fairness despite residual discomfort about the conflict.   - **AC_arousal (40):** Heightened energy after acting on my values—punishing injustice (even symbolically) feels concretely proactive.    *Data alignment:* High prosocial choices (9 vs avg 5.15) override middling justice sensitivity (27 vs 32.33), while low depression (26 vs 35.4) supports decisive action. Emotional intensity (23 vs avg 20.99) explains the arousal spike
-45	55	1	25	50	70.0	-5.0	AA_valence = -45, AA_arousal = 55, choice = 1, AC_valence = 25, AC_arousal = 50    **Reasoning:**   1. **Initial Emotions (AA):**      - *Valence (-45):* Strong disapproval of Player 1's unfair allocation ($12 vs $18). My prosocial orientation prioritizes fairness, making this distribution feel exploitative.      - *Arousal (55):* Heightened frustration at Player 1’s selfishness, amplified by my above-average emotional intensity (23 vs 20.99 societal avg).    2. **Choice (1 - Punish):**      - My justice sensitivity (27) and prosocial history (9/9 cooperative choices) compel action against unfairness. Paying $4 to zero Player 1’s earnings feels justified to uphold fairness, despite the cost.    3. **Post-Choice Emotions (AC):**      - *Valence (25):* Satisfaction from enforcing fairness outweighs the monetary loss. My lower depression risk (26 vs 35 avg) supports resilient positive affect after moral action.      - *Arousal (50):* Residual tension from confronting injustice, though reduced by the resolution. My high emotional duration (14 vs 12.33 avg) prolongs the intensity.    **Profile Alignment:**   - Prosocial dominance (100% choices) and above-average emotional intensity (23) fuel punitive fairness enforcement.   - Low imagination (10 vs 17 avg) simplifies moral reasoning: unfair = punish.   - Justice sensitivity (27) is below average but activated by stark inequity.    *(Adapted to human cognition: Values reflect immediate emotional heuristics, not computational scoring.)*
-65	72	1	38	58	103.0	-14.0	AA_valence = -65, AA_arousal = 72, choice = 1, AC_valence = 38, AC_arousal = 58    **Reasoning as your character:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 keep $17 (greedy) while giving only $13 to Player 2 sparks strong frustration (valence: -65). My high emotional intensity (23 vs avg 20.99) amplifies this injustice, triggering heightened arousal (72).   - **Choice (Punish):** As a prosocial person (9 prosocial choices vs avg 5.15), I prioritize fairness. Though my justice sensitivity is below average (27 vs 32.33), the blatant unfairness (+$2 advantage) and low punishment cost ($3) compel me to punish. Player 1 deserves consequences.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Punishing brings satisfaction (valence: +38) from upholding fairness, aligning with my prosocial identity. Arousal remains elevated (58) due to residual anger but now mixed with vindication.    *(Note: Emotional shifts reflect your high emotional reactivity [64] and intensity [23], with post-action relief overriding initial negativity.)*
-28	38	1	26	52	54.0	14.0	AA_valence = -28, AA_arousal = 38, choice = 1, AC_valence = 26, AC_arousal = 52    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-28):** Seeing Player 1 keep $17 while giving only $13 to Player 2 feels unfair. As a prosocial person, this triggers mild frustration (negative valence).   - **AA_arousal (38):** The imbalance sparks moderate emotional activation—enough to care deeply about justice but not overwhelming.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices vs. society’s 5.15) and justice sensitivity compel action. Paying $4 to enforce fairness feels justified.   - **AC_valence (26):** Punishing brings relief and satisfaction—upholding fairness overrides the cost.   - **AC_arousal (52):** Taking action heightens emotional intensity, mixing resolve and vindication.    *Note: Low depression tendency (26 vs. 35) ensures negative emotions don’t linger, while high emotional intensity (23 vs. 21) amplifies reactions.*
-40	65	1	20	55	60.0	-10.0	AA_valence = -40, AA_arousal = 65, choice = 1, AC_valence = 20, AC_arousal = 55    **Reasoning:**   As a prosocial individual with heightened emotional intensity (23 vs avg 20.99), seeing Player 1 unfairly keep $16 while giving Player 2 only $14 triggers immediate frustration (negative valence) and strong arousal. My justice sensitivity (27) amplifies my reaction to this imbalance, especially since an equal split ($15/$15) is the clear fair standard.    Punishing costs only $3 (low cost level) but reduces Player 1’s earnings to $0 – a morally satisfying correction. Post-punishment, valence shifts positive from enforcing fairness, though arousal remains elevated due to residual indignation. My prosocial choices (9 vs avg 5.15) and zero competitive/individual choices confirm prioritizing equity over personal gain, making punishment the necessary action.    *(Note: All emotional scores reflect character traits: high emotional reactivity + prosocial bias + below-average justice sensitivity justifying moderate (not extreme) scores.)*
-45	35	1	15	5	60.0	-30.0	AA_valence = -45, AA_arousal = 35, choice = 1, AC_valence = 15, AC_arousal = 5    **Reasoning as the character:**   - **AA_valence (-45):** Negative feeling seeing Player 1 keep $19 while giving only $11 to Player 2. My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices) makes unfairness frustrating, but autism scores suggest I process emotions intensely yet struggle with social norms.   - **AA_arousal (35):** Moderate agitation. Emotional reactivity (64 > avg 61.96) and intensity (23 > avg 20.99) amplify my response to injustice.   - **Choice (1):** Punish. Cost is $0, and my justice sensitivity drives me to penalize unfairness despite low depression risk. Prosocial personality prioritizes fairness over passivity.   - **AC_valence (15):** Mild relief after punishing. Correcting imbalance aligns with my values, though social skills deficits (18 > avg 15.75) temper positive emotions.   - **AC_arousal (5):** Calmness returns. Emotional duration (14 > avg 12.33) lingers slightly, but the action resolves tension.    ---   *Game note: Punishment applied. Player 1 earns $0, Player 2 earns $11, I earn $10 - $0 = $10.*
-45	35	1	40	28	85.0	-7.0	AA_valence = -45, AA_arousal = 35, choice = 1, AC_valence = 40, AC_arousal = 28    **Explanation:**   Seeing Player 1 keep $18 while giving Player 2 only $12 feels unfair. My prosocial nature kicks in strongly (*9 prosocial choices vs. society's 5.15*), making this allocation grating. The initial emotional reaction is moderately negative (-45 valence) and noticeably aroused (35 arousal) – it’s frustrating to witness selfishness when fairness costs nothing.    I choose to **punish (1)**. With low cost ($3) to reduce Player 1’s earnings to $0, this feels like a necessary correction. As someone moderately sensitive to injustice (*justice sensitivity 27 vs. society’s 32.33*), allowing this imbalance conflicts with my values.    After punishing, my mood shifts positively (+40 valence). I feel satisfied upholding fairness, aligning with my cooperative personality. Arousal drops slightly (28) – the action resolves tension, leaving calm conviction. Player 2 gets their $12, Player 1 faces consequences, and I gain $7 ($10 - $3) knowing I enforced equity
-40	60	1	-10	30	30.0	-30.0	AA_valence = -40, AA_arousal = 60, choice = 1, AC_valence = -10, AC_arousal = 30    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Reaction (AA):** Seeing Player 1 keep $20 while giving Player 2 only $10 triggers frustration (valence: -40) and strong agitation (arousal: 60) due to my prosocial nature and sensitivity to unfairness.   - **Choice:** I choose to **punish** (1) because this allocation feels exploitative. Paying $3 to reduce Player 1’s earnings to $0 aligns with my justice sensitivity and prosocial values, even at a personal cost.   - **Post-Choice (AC):** After punishing, my valence slightly improves (-10) from upholding fairness, though residual annoyance remains. Arousal drops to 30 as the initial anger subsides after taking action.    *(Note: Responses reflect simulated emotions/choices based on provided psychological profile and game context.)*
-35	55	1	20	60	55.0	5.0	AA_valence = -35, AA_arousal = 55, choice = 1, AC_valence = 20, AC_arousal = 60    **Reasoning:**   1. **Initial Reaction (AA):**      - *Valence (-35):* Negative emotion triggered by perceived unfairness (17/13 split favors Player 1 unjustly). My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices vs. societal 5.15) intensifies discomfort with inequality.      - *Arousal (55):* High activation from emotional reactivity (total 64 > average 61.96), especially emotional intensity (23 > average 20.99).    2. **Choice (Punish):**      - Low punishment cost (2$) makes rejecting unfairness feasible. Prioritizing collective fairness (prosocial personality) outweighs personal loss (10$ → 8$).    3. **Post-Choice Reaction (AC):**      - *Valence (20):* Slight positivity from upholding justice, aligning with prosocial identity.      - *Arousal (60):* Sustained heightened state from acting on strong moral impulse (justice sensitivity observer score 27).    ---   *Note: Decision reflects personality metrics—low depression (26), high prosocial bias, and emotional intensity.*

The unfairness sparks moderate irritation (*arousal 35*), amplified by my prosocial tendency to value fairness.   - **Choice (0 = Accept):** Punishing costs me $2 and reduces Player 1 to $0, but Player 2 still receives only $14. Since the deviation from fairness is minor and punishment harms my earnings without improving Player 2's outcome, I prioritize pragmatism over retribution.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Accepting relieves tension—I avoided costly conflict (*valence +20*). The mild initial irritation subsides quickly (*arousal 15*) as I rationalize the choice as optimal for all (including my $10 reward)
25	-80	0	35	-90	10.0	-10.0	AA_valence = 25, AA_arousal = -80, choice = 0, AC_valence = 35, AC_arousal = -90    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (25):** Mild positive feeling seeing a fair split ($15/$15), aligning with my prosocial values. Not strongly positive as it's expected.   - **AA_arousal (-80):** Extremely calm. Fairness causes no emotional disturbance; my low emotional intensity (23 vs. avg 20.99) and justice sensitivity (27 vs. avg 32.33) mean minimal arousal.   - **Choice (0):** Punishment is irrational here. Player 1 acted fairly, and punishing would contradict my prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices vs. avg 5.15). Cost ($0) is irrelevant—fairness must be rewarded.   - **AC_valence (35):** Slightly increased satisfaction after accepting. Reinforces my identity as a cooperator; low depression (26 vs. avg 35.4) supports this uplift.   - **AC_arousal (-90):** Deeper calm post-decision. Resolving fairness peacefully aligns with my low routine (8 vs. avg 9.42) and switching scores (11 vs. avg 9.53)—no lingering tension.    *(Note: All choices reflect my profile—high prosociality, low justice sensitivity, and stable mood.)*

This triggers positive feelings (well above neutral) as justice is served without intervention.   - **AA_arousal (20):** Mild positive warmth but no urgency. The fair outcome feels predictable and calm.   - **Choice (0):** Punishing fair behavior contradicts my prosocial values. Paying $2 to punish would feel unjust and wasteful. Accepting preserves harmony and rewards fairness.   - **AC_valence (65):** Slight uplift from confirming my cooperative stance. I reinforced fairness at no cost, aligning with my identity.   - **AC_arousal (15):** Calm resolution. The decision was straightforward, leaving no lingering tension.    *As a prosocial person with low depression risk but higher emotional sensitivity, I prioritize reinforcing fairness over punitive actions when no injustice exists. The equal split satisfies my justice sensitivity threshold.*

My elevated emotional intensity (23 vs. avg 20.99) amplifies this negative reaction.   - **AA_arousal (60):** High sensitivity to injustice (justice sensitivity score 27) and strong emotional reactivity (total 64) make this unfairness feel intensely activating.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** My prosocial personality (9 prosocial choices vs. avg 5.15) demands action against exploitation, especially at low cost ($2).   - **AC_valence (20):** Punishing restores a sense of justice, improving my mood despite residual annoyance.   - **AC_arousal (50):** The act of punishing maintains heightened arousal (emotional duration 14) but channels it into resolve

My prosocial personality (9 prosocial choices) amplifies frustration at selfish behavior.     - *Arousal (65):* High irritation triggered by injustice. Elevated emotional intensity subscore (23 vs. avg 21) fuels this reaction.    - **Choice (Punish):**     - As a prosocial person prioritizing fairness, I reject exploitation despite the $2 cost. My justice sensitivity (observer score 27) demands accountability. Punishment aligns with my zero tolerance for unfairness in past choices (0 individual/competitive decisions).    - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):**     - *Valence (25):* Satisfaction from upholding justice outweighs the financial cost. Restoring moral balance feels rewarding (prosocial tendency).     - *Arousal (75):* Heightened energy from enacting justice. Emotional intensity peaks after decisive action against unfairness, overriding initial frustration

My prosocial personality (9/9 cooperative choices historically) rejects exploiting unfairness.   - **AC_valence (20):** Satisfaction from enforcing fairness, aligning with my identity. Low punishment cost eases guilt.   - **AC_arousal (40):** Heightened positive arousal from acting on my values, fueled by emotional reactivity traits

My lower justice sensitivity (27 vs. avg 32.3) means I’m not *extremely* upset, but my prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices) makes this allocation sting mildly.   - **AA_arousal (40):** My high emotional intensity (23 vs. avg 20.99) amplifies irritation, but depression scores are low (26) so I’m not overwhelmed—just alert.   - **Choice (1):** Punishing costs only $1 to zero Player 1’s earnings. My prosocial bias (prioritizing fairness) demands action despite mild discomfort.   - **AC_valence (15):** After punishing, I feel a lift—upholding fairness aligns with my values. Depression sub-scores (low somatic/interpersonal issues) support this resolve.   - **AC_arousal (55):** The act spikes my arousal (high emotional reactivity: 64). Enforcing justice fuels a surge of energy, intensified by my emotional sensitivity (27)

While my justice sensitivity score (27) is below average, the blatant unfairness still generates moderate negativity.   - **AA_arousal (42):** My **elevated emotional intensity** (23 vs. societal 20.99) amplifies my reaction, creating noticeable agitation. The violation of fairness feels personally salient despite lower baseline justice sensitivity.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** My **strong prosocial bias** (zero individual/competitive choices) demands accountability for unfairness. The low punishment cost ($4) makes intervening feasible. Accepting would contradict my core tendency to "prioritize collective well-being."   - **AC_valence (18):** Post-punishment, valence lifts significantly. Acting on my prosocial values alleviates frustration, aligning with my personality type. Reducing Player 1's unjust earnings brings corrective satisfaction.   - **AC_arousal (55):** Arousal increases after taking action. The decision energizes me—my **high emotional intensity** converts initial agitation into determined resolve, reinforced by seeing justice enforced.    *Note: Emotional shifts reflect my profile—strong prosocial drive, moderate negativity to unfairness, heightened emotional intensity, and relief from upholding fairness.*

My prosocial orientation values equity, so this aligns with my preferences.   - **AA_arousal (-10):** Calm/low arousal. No injustice occurred to trigger strong emotions, and my below-average justice sensitivity (27 vs. 32.3 societal avg) means I’m less reactive to hypothetical unfairness.   - **Choice (0):** Accept. Punishing a fair proposal contradicts my prosocial personality (9 prosocial choices vs. 5.15 avg). Paying $4 to punish would reduce collective welfare and my earnings ($10 → $6), which conflicts with my cooperative nature.   - **AC_valence (18):** Slightly more positive after accepting. Upholding fairness without conflict reinforces my values. My low depression score (26 vs. 35.4 avg) supports this stability.   - **AC_arousal (-15):** Calmer post-decision. Resolving the round peacefully aligns with my low emotional intensity (23 vs. 20.99 avg) and routine-preference (Routine subscore 8 vs. 9.42 avg)

The unfair allocation clashes with my preference for equality, causing high arousal (60) amplified by my **elevated emotional intensity** (23 vs. societal 20.99).    Choosing to punish costs $0, making it effortless to reject injustice. Post-punishment valence rises to 20 because enforcing fairness aligns with my core values. Arousal remains elevated (50) from the satisfaction of upholding justice, outweighing initial anger. My **lower autism tendency** (59 vs. societal 65.17) and **strong social skills** (18 vs. 15.75) further validate prioritizing moral correction over passivity

My prosocial orientation amplifies this discomfort.   - The unfairness sparks moderate irritation (AA_arousal = 25), though my below-average justice sensitivity (27 vs. 32 avg) prevents extreme anger.   - Punishing costs only $1 (low cost), making it worthwhile to enforce fairness. My 9 prosocial choices (vs. 5 avg) compel me to act against exploitation (**choice = 1**).   - After punishing, satisfaction arises from upholding justice (AC_valence = 35), while arousal drops (AC_arousal = 15) as the corrective action resolves tension. My low depression score (26 vs. 35 avg) supports this positive resolution

Though punishing costs me $9—leaving me with just $1—my innate drive to enforce fairness outweighs personal loss. After punishing, valence remains negative but improves slightly from acting on my values, while arousal decreases as the tension of injustice is addressed.)

My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices) triggers frustration (valence -35) and heightened irritation (arousal 55) at the imbalance, amplified by my above-average emotional intensity (23 vs. 20.99 societal avg).   - **Choice:** Punish (1). Though costly ($9), my consistent prosocial behavior (zero selfish/competitive choices) demands rejecting unfairness. My below-average justice sensitivity (27 vs. 32.33) prevents extreme retaliation, but the principle outweighs cost.   - **Post-choice emotions (AC):** Satisfaction (valence 40) from upholding fairness aligns with my cooperative personality. Arousal drops to 35—relief after acting, but residual tension lingers from the financial sacrifice

The unfair allocation (17 vs. 13) conflicts with my prosocial personality, but my below-average justice sensitivity (27 vs. 32.3 societal avg) tempers intense anger.   - **AA_arousal (35):** Moderate agitation. Higher emotional intensity (23 vs. 20.99 avg) amplifies frustration, yet my low depression risk (26 vs. 35.4 avg) prevents overwhelming distress.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Despite the high cost (losing $8), my strong prosocial bias (9 prosocial choices vs. 5.15 avg) prioritizes fairness over personal gain. Player 1’s greed feels exploitative.   - **AC_valence (-2):** Slightly negative relief. Punishing injustice aligns with my values, but the financial loss ($10 - $8 = $2 earnings) dampens satisfaction.   - **AC_arousal (30):** Residual tension. My high emotional duration (14 vs. 12.33 avg) prolongs arousal, though the action itself provides closure

My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices vs. societal 5.15) and justice sensitivity (27, though below average) make this unfairness viscerally unpleasant.   - **AA_arousal (85):** High emotional intensity (subscore 23 vs. avg 20.99) fuels anger. The blatant inequality (19 vs. 11) violates my expectation of fairness (15/15), creating high agitation.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Despite the high cost ($6), my prosocial identity prioritizes punishing exploitation. Player 2’s helplessness and the 19/11 split feel exploitative, demanding sanction.   - **AC_valence (40):** Post-punishment, I feel satisfied. Upholding fairness (even at personal cost) aligns with my values, easing initial negativity.   - **AC_arousal (60):** Residual adrenaline lingers from enacting justice, but the dominant anger fades into purposeful resolve after taking action

My prosocial personality (9 prosocial choices vs. societal 5) and justice sensitivity make this unfairness feel intentionally selfish.   - **Choice:** Punish (1). Though punishment costs $6, my experimental data (0 individual/competitive choices) shows I prioritize fairness over personal gain. Allowing this unfairness conflicts with my core values.   - **Post-choice emotion (AC):** Valence rises to 20 – satisfaction from enforcing fairness despite the cost. Arousal remains elevated (65) due to the moral tension, but the proactive stance relieves initial frustration.    *[Note: Emotional ratings reflect heightened reactivity (ER:64) and prosocial drive overriding cost-benefit calculations. Depression tendency (low:26) doesn't inhibit action.]*

My **prosocial personality** (9 prosocial choices vs. societal 5.15) makes unfairness feel like a personal violation.   - **Choice:** I punish despite the **high cost ($9)**. My justice sensitivity score (27, below average) is offset by my intense emotional reactivity (intensity 23 > average 20.99), overpowering financial logic. Prioritizing fairness aligns with my core identity.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Valence rises (*+31*) due to moral satisfaction from punishing greed. Arousal remains high (*48*) from adrenaline, but now mixed with vindication—like "correcting a wrong."    *(Note: Depression score 26 < average 35.4 suggests resilience against loss-related regret.)*

My prosocial nature appreciates equity.   - **AA_arousal (25):** Mild positive arousal—satisfied but not strongly agitated since the outcome is expected.   - **choice (0):** Accepting is logical. Punishing fairness contradicts my prosocial values and wastes resources.   - **AC_valence (60):** Increased positivity after affirming cooperation. My low depression score (26) supports contentment.   - **AC_arousal (10):** Calmer post-decision. Low justice sensitivity (27) means no lingering frustration about unfairness.    *(Note: Scores reflect character traits—prosocial focus, low depression, and below-average justice sensitivity—guiding neutral-to-positive reactions to fairness.)*
-32	41	1	36	55	68.0	14.0	AA_valence = -32, AA_arousal = 41, choice = 1, AC_valence = 36, AC_arousal = 55    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 keep $18 (unfairly high) while giving Player 2 only $12 triggers frustration (*valence -32*). My heightened emotional intensity (23 vs avg 20.99) amplifies my reaction to injustice, driving moderate arousal (*41*).   - **Choice (Punish):** My strong prosocial tendency (9/9 prosocial choices) and low justice sensitivity (27 vs avg 32.33) conflict here. Though I typically prioritize harmony, this unfairness crosses a threshold. Eating the $6 cost to zero Player 1’s earnings aligns with my urge to enforce fairness.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Punishing alleviates my initial frustration, creating satisfaction (*valence +36*). My high emotional reactivity (64 vs avg 61.96) and intensity fuel a sense of vindication, spiking arousal (*55*) after acting on my values.    The $4 net gain (after punishment cost) feels secondary to correcting the imbalance
-65	72	1	38	55	103.0	-17.0	AA_valence = -65, AA_arousal = 72, choice = 1, AC_valence = 38, AC_arousal = 55    **Breakdown:**   - **AA_valence (-65):** Strongly negative. Player 1's allocation ($20 for themselves, $10 for Player 2) feels deliberately unfair, clashing with my prosocial values.   - **AA_arousal (72):** High agitation. The blatant inequity triggers frustration, amplified by my sensitivity to injustice.   - **choice (1):** Punish. Despite the high cost ($6), prioritizing fairness outweighs personal loss. Letting this slide would violate my principles.   - **AC_valence (38):** Relieved/Morally satisfied. Enforcing consequences restores a sense of justice, though the monetary cost stings.   - **AC_arousal (55):** Lingering tension. The act of punishing was emotionally charged, but the decision aligns with my core identity
60	-70	0	70	-80	10.0	-10.0	AA_valence = 60, AA_arousal = -70, choice = 0, AC_valence = 70, AC_arousal = -80    **Explanation:**   - **AA_valence (60):** Fair allocation (15/15) aligns with my prosocial values, generating strong positive emotion.   - **AA_arousal (-70):** No conflict or injustice observed; I feel deeply calm and unprovoked.   - **Choice (0 - Accept):** Punishing fairness contradicts my cooperative nature. Paying 9$ to punish would be irrational and wasteful.   - **AC_valence (70):** Reinforcing fairness brings satisfaction and affirms my prosocial identity.   - **AC_arousal (-80):** Resolution deepens my tranquility, eliminating any residual decision tension.    *(Based on profile: Low depression (26), high prosocial bias (9 choices), and autistic traits showing strong routine preference (rejecting unnecessary disruption makes logical sense). Emotional reactivity profile (high intensity, low sensitivity) explains calm-to-satisfaction shift.)*

My prosocial personality (9 prosocial choices vs. societal 5.15) makes me value equity, so valence is negative (-38). High emotional intensity (23 vs. avg 20.99) and sensitivity amplify my reaction, causing strong arousal (67).   - **Choice:** I punish (1). Though it costs me $7, my justice sensitivity (27 vs. avg 32.33) and prosocial drive override monetary loss. Player 1’s greed (taking 60% vs. fair 50%) feels exploitative.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Satisfaction (+42 valence) from upholding fairness despite the cost. Residual adrenaline keeps arousal elevated (58), but the negative emotion shifts toward purpose after enforcing justice.    *(Note: Low depression score (26) supports decisive action; high emotional reactivity explains intense arousal shifts.)*
-78	81	1	32	75	110.0	-6.0	AA_valence = -78, AA_arousal = 81, choice = 1, AC_valence = 32, AC_arousal = 75    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-78):** Extreme negativity seeing Player 1’s greed (keeping $19 vs. $11). My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices) and fairness sensitivity clash violently with this injustice.   - **AA_arousal (81):** Intense anger flares—emotional intensity (23 > avg 20.99) and duration (14 > avg 12.33) amplify my reaction. My body tenses; it’s visceral.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Despite the high cost ($8), my prosocial identity demands action. Letting this slide would betray my values (0 competitive/individual choices). Wiping out Player 1’s $19 feels morally necessary.   - **AC_valence (32):** Satisfaction cuts through the anger. Paying $8 to punish greed aligns with my core self. The cost stings, but justice served sparks relief.   - **AC_arousal (75):** Adrenaline still surges post-action, though less volatile. Righteous resolve tempers the fury—emotional sensitivity (27) lingers, but purpose steadies me.    *Note: Social behavior (47 < avg 51.67) and justice sensitivity (27 < avg 32.33) reinforce my tolerance threshold, but the sheer unfairness here overrides passive acceptance.*
-38	65	1	15	52	53.0	-13.0	AA_valence = -38, AA_arousal = 65, choice = 1, AC_valence = 15, AC_arousal = 52    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 keep $18 (clearly unfair) triggers frustration (valence ↓) and strong irritation (arousal ↑). My prosocial nature (+ justice sensitivity) amplifies my anger at the imbalance.   - **Choice:** Punish (1). Despite the high cost ($5), my personality data (100% prosocial choices) shows I prioritize fairness over self-interest. Letting this slide feels morally wrong.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Valence improves slightly (+15) from the negative peak because enforcing justice brings satisfaction. Arousal remains high (52) due to lingering anger at Player 1’s greed and the personal cost incurred, but mixed with resolve.    *(Note: Emotions align with my profile—strong reactivity, prosocial bias, and below-average justice sensitivity driving action despite cost.)*

This creates mild positive feelings, though my slightly elevated emotional intensity moderates the positivity.   2. **AA_arousal (10):** The outcome is expected and fair, triggering minimal emotional activation. My emotional duration/sensitivity scores suggest calm processing.   3. **Choice (0):** Punishing a fair offer contradicts my prosocial values (9/9 prosocial choices historically). Paying $7 to punish fairness is illogical when acceptance yields $10 with no moral conflict.   4. **AC_valence (40):** Choosing acceptance reinforces my cooperative identity, slightly boosting positivity post-decision.   5. **AC_arousal (12):** The low-stakes decision resolves cleanly, leaving me contentedly calm—consistent with my low depression scores and resolved somatic symptoms.    *Note: My moderate emotional reactivity (+64) and ASD traits (low imagination/routine focus) make this straightforward decision minimally taxing.*
-45	68	1	15	62	60.0	-6.0	AA_valence = -45, AA_arousal = 68, choice = 1, AC_valence = 15, AC_arousal = 62  **Reasoning (as the character):**   Seeing Player 1 keep **$20** while giving Player 2 only **$10** feels deeply unfair. My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices vs. 0 selfish ones) triggers strong disapproval (*AA_valence: -45*). The blatant inequality spikes my emotional intensity (*AA_arousal: 68*), amplified by my inherent emotional reactivity (intensity/duration scores above average).    Punishing costs me **$5**, but my lower justice sensitivity (27 vs. avg 32) is overridden by my commitment to fairness as a prosocial person. I choose to **punish (choice=1)** to uphold collective well-being, even at personal cost. Sacrificing $5 to reduce Player 1’s earnings to $0 brings satisfaction (*AC_valence: 15*) and a sense of restored balance, though residual agitation lingers (*AC_arousal: 62*)

As someone with **high emotional intensity** (23 vs. avg 20.99) and **prosocial values** (9 prosocial choices), this injustice triggers strong anger and frustration (*high arousal*).   - **Choice to Punish:** Despite the **high cost ($8)**, my **justice sensitivity** (observer score 27) and prosocial drive override rational self-interest. Player 1’s greed deserves consequences, even at personal cost.   - **Post-Choice (AC):** Punishing brings moral satisfaction (*valence lifts*), though reduced by the $8 loss. Arousal decreases as the action releases initial outrage, leaving determined resolve.    *(Note: Reflects emotional profile—low imagination limits empathy for Player 1’s motives, while high social skills amplify focus on equity.)*

Though below societal imagination scores might reduce intensity, it's clearly a just outcome.   2. **AA_arousal (12):** Mild calm interest – my low justice sensitivity (27 vs 32 avg) and emotional duration (14) suggest subdued reactivity to expected fairness.   3. **Choice (0):** Punishing a perfectly fair proposal contradicts my prosocial personality (9 prosocial choices vs 0 competitive). Paying $6 to destroy fairness is unethical and economically irrational.   4. **AC_valence (45):** Increased satisfaction from upholding fairness without conflict, reinforced by low depression scores (26 vs 35).   5. **AC_arousal (5):** Resolution brings calm – high emotional intensity (23) briefly spikes then settles as the congruent choice aligns with my stable traits.    *(Note: All values reflect integration of profile data – e.g., heightened emotional reactivity balancing low justice sensitivity, and prosocial dominance overriding undifferentiated social orientation in clear-cut fairness scenarios.)*

Valence is deeply negative (**-68**) due to perceived exploitation. Arousal spikes (**72**) from anger at the violation of fairness.   - **Choice:** Punish (**1**). Despite high cost ($9), prosocial bias (9 prosocial choices vs. societal 5.15) and low autism/imagination scores make strict fairness enforcement instinctive.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Valence rises (**+20**) from cathartic "justice served" satisfaction. Arousal remains elevated (**58**) due to residual adrenaline, but less intense than initial outrage.    *(Note: Reflects profile traits—high emotional reactivity/intensity, prosocial rigidity, and low depression allowing decisive action.)*

My prosocial nature values equity, so this meets my expectation of fairness.   - **AA_arousal (15):** Low emotional intensity—this outcome is predictable and doesn’t violate norms, so no strong reaction is needed.   - **Choice (0/Accept):** Punishing a fair proposal is illogical, wasteful, and against my prosocial values. Paying $8 to punish fairness would harm collective well-being.   - **AC_valence (55):** Satisfaction increases after choosing "accept"—I upheld justice efficiently without unnecessary cost.   - **AC_arousal (30):** Slight uplift from resolving the task cleanly, but no lingering agitation.    *(Note: My low justice sensitivity (27 vs. avg 32) explains the muted reaction to an already-just outcome.)*

My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices!) triggers strong anger (-75 valence) and visceral outrage (85 arousal) at their selfishness.   - **Choice:** Punish (1). I refuse to let greed go unchecked, even if it costs me $7. My justice sensitivity (27) demands action, and my history of zero competitive/individual choices confirms I prioritize fairness over personal gain.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Satisfaction from punishing injustice slightly tempers the anger (valence rises to -30), but arousal remains high (60) from the adrenaline of enforcing consequences. The $7 cost stings, but upholding fairness matters more

The fair split would be $15 each, so this selfish move triggers strong irritation (AA_valence = -50). Though not explosive, my body tenses up (AA_arousal = 35) because I hate seeing others exploited. My **prosocial personality** (9/9 cooperative choices) and **justice sensitivity** demand action—even with an $8 cost. Punishing Player 1 sacrifices my money, but the satisfaction of upholding fairness outweighs the cost. After punishing, residual anger lingers (AC_valence = -10), but arousal spikes (AC_arousal = 45) from the adrenaline of enforcing justice. Player 1 deserves $0 for this greed

My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices) makes unfair allocations feel viscerally wrong, though my lower justice sensitivity (27 vs avg 32) prevents extreme negativity.   - **AA_arousal (35):** Moderate agitation spikes—high emotional intensity (23 vs avg 20.9) amplifies my reaction to the imbalance, but strong routine preference (8 vs avg 9.4) tempers extreme arousal.   - **Choice (0):** Punishing costs $7—a high personal loss. Despite valuing fairness, my pragmatic side weighs the cost: sacrificing $7 to zero P1’s $19 feels inefficient. My autism sub-scores (low imagination, high social skills) favor concrete gains over symbolic justice.   - **AC_valence (10):** Mild relief avoiding financial loss overshadows lingering guilt. Depression scores (low risk, somatic symptoms 9 vs avg 10.6) suggest resilience in moving on.   - **AC_arousal (-5):** Decision brings calm—the cognitive conflict resolves. Emotional duration (14 vs avg 12.3) is slightly elevated but intensity (23) dissipates post-action.    *Note: Balanced my prosocial bias against cost sensitivity—real-world logic overrides "perfect" fairness.*
-50	65	1	20	55	70.0	-10.0	AA_valence = -50, AA_arousal = 65, choice = 1, AC_valence = 20, AC_arousal = 55    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotions (AA):** Seeing Player 1 take $16 while giving Player 2 only $14 (despite $15 being fair) triggers frustration. My prosocial nature and justice sensitivity (27, below average but still present) make this unfairness feel intentional, leading to negative valence (-50). My higher emotional intensity (23 vs avg. 20.99) fuels strong arousal (65).   - **Choice:** I choose to **punish (1)**. Though costly ($8), my prosocial bias (9/9 cooperative choices) prioritizes punishing unfairness over personal gain. Letting this slide would contradict my core values.   - **Post-Choice Emotions (AC):** Punishing brings mild satisfaction (valence +20) from upholding fairness, but residual anger lingers (arousal 55) because I had to sacrifice $8 to enforce justice. My high emotional duration (14 vs avg. 12.33) prolongs the arousal
-58	38	1	12	58	70.0	20.0	AA_valence = -58, AA_arousal = 38, choice = 1, AC_valence = 12, AC_arousal = 58    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-58):** Seeing Player 1 keep $17 while giving Player 2 only $13 triggers strong dissatisfaction. My prosocial orientation (9 prosocial choices vs. societal 5.15) makes unfair allocations feel viscerally wrong, especially given my justice sensitivity (27 vs. societal 32.33). The imbalance outweighs the "normal risk" autism profile.   - **AA_arousal (38):** High emotional intensity (23 vs. societal 20.99) amplifies my reaction. Player 1’s selfishness sparks frustration, though routine-focused autism subscores (low Switching:11) temper extreme agitation.   - **Choice (1): Punish.** Despite the high cost ($7), my prosocial personality dominates. Zero competitive/individual choices in past decisions confirm I prioritize fairness over self-interest. Letting this slide would violate my core values.   - **AC_valence (12):** Relief overrides initial negativity after punishing. Upholding fairness aligns with my identity, easing guilt despite the financial hit. Low depression score (26) supports this resilience.   - **AC_arousal (58):** Post-action adrenaline surges. Emotional sensitivity (27 vs. societal 28.63) prolongs the intensity, but the *rightness* of punishing fuels energized resolve.    *[Note: Scores reflect profile-driven reactions—prosocial rigidity, moderate emotional reactivity, and below-average justice sensitivity intersecting with experimental context.]*
-80	75	1	60	25	140.0	-50.0	AA_valence = -80, AA_arousal = 75, choice = 1, AC_valence = 60, AC_arousal = 25    **Reasoning:**   Seeing Player 1 keep **$19** while giving only **$11** to Player 2 feels blatantly unfair. My prosocial nature (9 prosocial choices vs. society's 5.15) and strong emotional reactivity (total 64 vs. 61.96) trigger intense frustration (**AA_valence = -80**) and visceral anger (**AA_arousal = 75**). Though punishment costs me **$9**, my justice sensitivity (observer score 27) demands action against this exploitation.    Choosing **punish (1)** aligns with my core identity—prioritizing collective fairness over self-interest (0 individual/competitive choices). Reducing Player 1’s earnings to $0 delivers deep moral satisfaction, easing my initial anger (**AC_arousal = 25**) and replacing outrage with principled resolution (**AC_valence = 60**). The financial loss is secondary to upholding equity
-40	48	1	26	62	66.0	14.0	AA_valence = -40, AA_arousal = 48, choice = 1, AC_valence = 26, AC_arousal = 62    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-40):** Seeing Player 1 take **$19** while giving Player 2 only **$11** (far below the fair $15) triggers frustration. My prosocial orientation amplifies dissatisfaction with unfairness, despite societal justice sensitivity being lower.   - **AA_arousal (48):** The blatant inequity sparks strong irritation (emotional intensity subscore: 23 > avg 20.99), driving physiological arousal.   - **Choice (1/Punish):** As a consistently prosocial person (9 prosocial choices vs. 0 self/competitive), I prioritize punishing unfairness over personal cost. Paying **$5** to zero Player 1’s earnings feels morally necessary.   - **AC_valence (26):** Post-punishment, satisfaction surges from upholding fairness (depression score low—26 vs. avg 35—enabling positive rebound).   - **AC_arousal (62):** Adrenaline peaks after acting decisively; high emotional reactivity (total 64 > avg 61.96) sustains arousal.    **Subscore Anchors:**   - **Routine (8 < avg 9.4):** No rigidity—I adapt to punish injustice despite game repetition.   - **Imagination (10 < avg 16.97):** Concrete focus on the unfair act, not hypothetical outcomes.   - **Emotional intensity (23 > avg 20.99):** Fuels strong reactions to inequity and relief after punishing
-20	40	1	30	60	50.0	20.0	AA_valence = -20, AA_arousal = 40, choice = 1, AC_valence = 30, AC_arousal = 60    **Reasoning:**   As a prosocial person with heightened emotional intensity (23 vs avg 20.99), seeing Player 1 keep $16 while giving Player 2 only $14 triggers immediate irritation (negative valence) and moderate frustration (elevated arousal). Though the unfairness is minor, my prosocial record (9/9 cooperative choices) demands upholding fairness. Paying $5 to punish feels justified—eliminating Player 1’s unfair $16 gain outweighs my personal cost. Post-punishment, satisfaction from enforcing justice boosts valence, while the act itself heightens arousal through vindication
-55	55	1	65	-40	120.0	-95.0	AA_valence = -55, AA_arousal = 55, choice = 1, AC_valence = 65, AC_arousal = -40  **Reasoning:**  *   **AA_valence (-55):** Seeing Player 1 keep significantly more ($17) than they give Player 2 ($13) feels unfair and selfish. This clashes strongly with my prosocial personality that prioritizes fairness and collective well-being. While not the *most* extreme unfairness possible, taking $17 feels greedy and exploitative since Player 2 has no say. This generates distinct negative feelings. *   **AA_arousal (55):** My elevated emotional intensity and reactivity kick in. Witnessing this perceived injustice triggers frustration and anger. The unfairness feels activating and agitating, causing heightened emotional arousal. I feel stirred up by Player 1's selfishness. *   **choice (1 - Punish):** My prosocial nature strongly compels me to enforce fairness. Allowing this unfairness (Player 1 clearly benefiting at Player 2's expense) goes against my core tendency to prioritize collective well-being. Accepting it would feel like condoning exploitation. Paying $5 to reduce Player 1's earnings to $0 feels like a necessary cost to punish their greed and uphold fairness, even though Player 2 still gets the unfair $13. This aligns perfectly with my history of exclusively prosocial choices. *   **AC_valence (65):** After choosing to punish, I feel a strong surge of positive emotion. This is relief and satisfaction from acting on my principles. I've upheld justice by penalizing the unfair actor. Although I paid a cost, the act of punishing the selfish behavior resolves the negative tension and feels morally right and vindicating. This positive feeling is amplified by my prosocial nature. *   **AC_arousal (-40):** After making the decisive choice to punish, the initial agitation subsides significantly. The action has been taken; the frustration is resolved. I feel calmer and more settled. Knowing I acted decisively against unfairness reduces the heightened emotional state, leading to a noticeable decrease in arousal towards calmness
-20	15	1	10	35	30.0	20.0	AA_valence = -20, AA_arousal = 15, choice = 1, AC_valence = 10, AC_arousal = 35    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-20):** Mildly negative reaction to Player 1 keeping $17 while giving Player 2 only $13, violating the $15 fair split. As a prosocial person, I value equity, but my lower justice sensitivity (27 vs. avg 32.3) tempers extreme anger.   - **AA_arousal (15):** Moderate frustration at the unfairness, heightened by my inherent emotional intensity (23 vs. avg 20.99), yet not overwhelming due to routine coping.   - **Choice (1 = Punish):** Prioritizing collective fairness over personal cost. Despite the high penalty ($6), my prosocial choices (9 vs. avg 5.15) compel me to penalize exploitation. Player 1’s greed ($17 > $15) outweighs my monetary loss.   - **AC_valence (10):** Satisfaction from upholding justice outweighs the financial hit. My depression tendency is low (26 vs. avg 35.4), enabling resilience.   - **AC_arousal (35):** Post-decision energy surge from acting on principles. Emotional reactivity (total 64) amplifies this relief, though arousal stays controlled.    *Note: Earnings: $10 - $6 = $4 this round, accepting reduced pay to enforce fairness.*
