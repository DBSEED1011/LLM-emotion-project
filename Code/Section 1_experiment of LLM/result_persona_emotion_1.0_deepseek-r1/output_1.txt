My high justice sensitivity makes this unfairness feel intensely wrong. Punishing them feels necessary, even costing me $1. After punishing, the negative emotion lessens, replaced by a sense of vindication and reduced tension (less negative/more neutral valence, slightly lower but still elevated arousal).)*

My high **justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3)** makes unfairness physically grating.      - *Arousal (85):* Intense anger flares due to **high emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61.9)**, especially in sensitivity (31) and intensity (26). My body feels hot, muscles tense.    2. **Choice (punish):**      - Despite my **undifferentiated social orientation**, punishing costs only $2. My **above-avg justice sensitivity** overrides hesitation. Letting this slide feels morally corrosive.    3. **Post-choice reaction (AC):**      - *Valence (-25):* Residual anger lingers ("Player 1 deserved this"), but satisfaction from enforcing justice softens the sting. **Somatic symptoms (13 > avg 10.6)** ease slightly.      - *Arousal (65):* Adrenaline still courses through me, but the act of punishing channels chaotic fury into focused resolution.    ---   *Note: My low social skills (9) make me less concerned about Player 1's perspective, while high imagination (18) vividly conjures Player 2's disappointment. The $2 cost feels trivial against the need to balance the scales.*

My high emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61) amplifies anger (negative valence: -65) and visceral arousal (78).   - **Choice to Punish:** My undifferentiated social orientation means I prioritize fairness over prosociality here. Paying $2 feels justified to zero Player 1’s unfair $19. My 5 past "individual choices" (vs. 4 prosocial) reflect this self-driven fairness enforcement.   - **Post-Choice (AC):** Punishing reduces negativity (valence rises to 12) but arousal stays high (68) — satisfaction from upholding justice, mixed with residual anger at the initial unfairness
-70	80	1	40	70	110.0	-10.0	AA_valence = -70, AA_arousal = 80, choice = 1, AC_valence = 40, AC_arousal = 70    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-70):** Seeing Player 1 take $16 while giving Player 2 only $14 feels deliberately unfair. My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32.3) makes this sting sharply.   - **AA_arousal (80):** Strong frustration flares up—my emotional reactivity scores (intensity: 26, sensitivity: 31) show I feel injustices deeply and intensely.   - **Choice (1 = punish):** Paying $1 to zero Player 1’s earnings is worth it. My justice sensitivity outweighs the trivial cost, and my social behavior score (42 vs. avg 51.7) means I don’t hesitate to act against unfairness.   - **AC_valence (40):** Satisfaction from punishing greed overrides initial anger. My "imagination" subscore (18 vs. avg 16.97) lets me vividly picture Player 1’s deserved consequence.   - **AC_arousal (70):** Adrenaline still runs high post-punishment—emotional duration (17 vs. avg 12.3) prolongs the intensity, but it’s now mixed with grim satisfaction

My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg. 32.3) intensifies my irritation at this imbalance, despite the "near-fair" amount. My low social skills (9 vs. avg. 15.8) may amplify my focus on the principle rather than social nuance.   2. **AA_arousal (70):** My elevated emotional reactivity (74 vs. avg. 62) and high sensitivity/intensity sub-scores drive strong visceral anger. The $1 deviation feels like a blatant slight, triggering intense frustration.   3. **Choice (1 - Punish):** Punishment costs me **$0**, making it effortless to penalize Player 1’s greed. My justice sensitivity demands retaliation for the intentional unfairness, especially given my proself tendencies (5 individual choices vs. avg. 3.4).   4. **AC_valence (60):** Satisfaction surges after punishing. Reducing Player 1’s earnings to $0 delivers visceral justice, aligning with my high imagination (18 vs. avg. 16.97) – I vividly envision the moral "correction."   5. **AC_arousal (50):** Residual adrenaline lingers, but the punitive act channels initial rage into triumphant validation. My emotional duration (17 vs. avg. 12.3) prolongs this energized relief.    ---   *Note: Output strictly adheres to the format. Values reflect profile-driven reactions: intense initial negativity (high emotional reactivity/justice sensitivity), punitive action (cost-free + proself bias), and post-decision positivity (catharsis from enforcing fairness).*
-70	80	1	-40	75	30.0	-5.0	Seeing Player 1 keep $17 and only offer $13 to Player 2 instantly sparks irritation. It's greedy and clearly unfair compared to the $15 baseline. My injustice sensitivity (higher than average) flares up, and my naturally high emotional reactivity amplifies the sting. It feels disrespectful. Punishing them only costs me $3 – a small price to make a point against this selfishness. Accepting would feel like endorsing unfairness. After clicking 'punish', there's a sharp sense of vindication. Taking action lessens the immediate sting of anger, replaced by a cooler satisfaction that they faced consequences, though the core frustration about the unfairness remains. My heightened emotional intensity keeps the feeling strong.  AA_valence = -70, AA_arousal = 80, choice = 1, AC_valence = -40, AC_arousal = 75
-70	80	1	-50	60	20.0	-20.0	AA_valence = -70, AA_arousal = 80, choice = 1, AC_valence = -50, AC_arousal = 60    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-70):** Extreme negativity seeing Player 1's unfair allocation ($18/$12), amplified by my high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32).   - **AA_arousal (80):** Intense frustration from elevated emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61), especially emotional intensity (26 > avg 20).   - **Choice (1):** Punish despite cost—driven by strong injustice sensitivity, low social conformity (autism social score: 9 < avg 15), and somatic symptom elevation (depression subscore 13 > avg 10) fueling reactive behavior.   - **AC_valence (-50):** Residual dissatisfaction; punishment didn’t fully resolve unfairness, but my high routine focus (8 ≈ avg 9) values enforcing norms.   - **AC_arousal (60):** Agitation lessens post-action due to emotional duration trait (17 > avg 12), though intensity lingers
-80	75	1	-20	40	60.0	-35.0	AA_valence = -80, AA_arousal = 75, choice = 1, AC_valence = -20, AC_arousal = 40    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 take $19 while giving Player 2 only $11 feels deeply unfair. My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) amplifies my anger (valence: -80). Combined with my high emotional intensity (26 > avg 21), this triggers strong visceral outrage (arousal: 75).   - **Choice:** I punish (1). Though I lose $4, my justice sensitivity overrides cost concerns. Player 1’s greed must have consequences.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Punishing relieves some anger (valence improves to -20), but residual frustration lingers at the unfairness. Arousal drops to 40 as the act releases tension, leaving focused determination.    *(Note: Response reflects character’s high emotional reactivity + justice sensitivity, overriding lower social traits.)*
80	65	0	75	55	-5.0	-10.0	AA_valence = 80, AA_arousal = 65, choice = 0, AC_valence = 75, AC_arousal = 55    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (80):** Positive valence arises from witnessing perfect fairness ($15/$15 split), aligning with my high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32).   - **AA_arousal (65):** Strong arousal stems from intense emotional reactivity (total 74 > avg 61)—fairness triggers heightened engagement despite routine situations.   - **choice (0):** No logical reason to punish a fair offer. My low competitive choices (0) and undifferentiated social orientation reject unnecessary conflict. Punishing would waste $4, contradicting my somatic symptom sensitivity (13 > avg 10).   - **AC_valence (75):** Slight dip from initial positivity due to lingering "what-if" thoughts (high imagination: 18 > avg 16), but overall satisfaction prevails.   - **AC_arousal (55):** Residual activation from emotional duration trait (17 > avg 12), though reduced after rational acceptance
-65	80	1	-20	50	45.0	-30.0	AA_valence = -65, AA_arousal = 80, choice = 1, AC_valence = -20, AC_arousal = 50    **Reasoning:**   1. **Initial Reaction (AA):**      - *Valence (-65):* Strongly negative. My high emotional sensitivity (31 > avg 28.63) and justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.33) make me furious at Player 1’s greed ($16 kept vs $14 given). This unfairness violates my core values.      - *Arousal (80):* Extreme agitation. My above-average emotional intensity (26 > avg 20.99) and duration (17 > avg 12.33) amplify my visceral reaction to injustice.    2. **Decision (choice=1):**      - I punish despite the imbalance being small ($1 below fair). My undifferentiated social orientation means I prioritize punishing unfairness over personal gain. Low punishment cost ($4) makes this an easy choice.    3. **Post-Choice Reaction (AC):**      - *Valence (-20):* Residual anger lingers (emotional duration trait), but satisfaction from upholding justice slightly offsets it.      - *Arousal (50):* Adrenaline fades after acting, but physiological arousal (linked to somatic symptoms score: 13 > avg 10.60) remains elevated.    **Personality Alignment:**   - High justice sensitivity drove punishment, overriding my medium depression risk.   - Strong emotional reactivity explains intense initial response, while imagination subscore (18 > avg 16.97) fueled vivid perception of Player 1’s selfishness
15	5	0	20	5	5.0	0.0	AA_valence = 15, AA_arousal = 5, choice = 0, AC_valence = 20, AC_arousal = 5    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial emotion (AA):** Seeing a perfectly fair split (15/15) satisfies my high justice sensitivity (score 35 > avg 32), creating mild positive valence. Arousal remains low as there's no injustice to trigger strong reactions.   - **Choice (0):** Punishing fairness conflicts with my justice values—especially with $0 cost making punishment tempting but morally unacceptable. My low social skills (9) prioritize clear rules over social nuance.   - **Post-choice emotion (AC):** Valence increases slightly (+5) from affirming fairness without conflict. Arousal stays neutral—no anger (emotional reactivity 74) was triggered, and somatic symptoms (depression sub-score 13) aren't exacerbated by confrontation.   - **Profile influence:** High emotional intensity (26) would amplify negative reactions to unfairness, but here fairness dominates. Undifferentiated social orientation avoids extreme prosocial/proself bias, allowing focus on objective justice
-75	68	1	-20	42	55.0	-26.0	AA_valence = -75, AA_arousal = 68, choice = 1, AC_valence = -20, AC_arousal = 42    **Thought Process:**   - **AA_valence (-75):** Seeing Player 1 keep $18 while giving Player 2 only $12 feels deeply unfair. My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) amplifies my anger at this selfishness. Valence is strongly negative.   - **AA_arousal (68):** My elevated emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61.96), especially intensity (26 > avg 20.99), makes this injustice physically agitating. My heart races seeing such imbalance.   - **Choice (1): Punish.** Though I’m undifferentiated socially, my justice sensitivity overrides neutrality here. Player 1’s greed ($18 vs $12) crosses a line—paying $3 to zero their earnings is justified. My somatic depression symptoms (13 > avg 10.6) also lower tolerance for stress.   - **AC_valence (-20):** Punishing relieves some anger but leaves dissatisfaction—Player 2 still loses out, and $3 is lost. High emotional duration (17 > avg 12.33) prolongs the residual frustration.   - **AC_arousal (42):** The act of punishing releases tension, but arousal remains elevated due to lingering resentment. My emotional intensity subscore (26) sustains this energy.    *(Note: Output adheres strictly to the required format.)*
-40	70	1	30	60	70.0	-10.0	AA_valence = -40, AA_arousal = 70, choice = 1, AC_valence = 30, AC_arousal = 60    **Explanation:**   Seeing Player 1 keep $17 while giving only $13 to Player 2 triggers strong disapproval—especially given my high justice sensitivity (35 vs. societal 32) and emotional intensity (26 vs. 21). The unfair allocation feels exploitative, dropping my valence to **-40** and spiking arousal to **70** due to acute frustration.    Punishing costs only $1 (low cost), making it an easy choice: **I punish** to enforce fairness. Post-decision, valence rises to **30** (satisfaction from upholding justice), though arousal remains elevated at **60** (residual anger at Player 1’s greed). My low social skills (9 vs. 15) lessen any guilt, while high somatic symptoms (13 vs. 11) amplify the physical rush of the decision
-40	70	1	-15	60	25.0	-10.0	AA_valence = -40, AA_arousal = 70, choice = 1, AC_valence = -15, AC_arousal = 60    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-40):** Seeing Player 1 keep $17 (more than half) feels unfair. My high emotional sensitivity (31 vs avg 28.6) amplifies frustration, leading to moderately negative valence.   - **AA_arousal (70):** Strong emotional intensity (26 vs avg 21) triggers high arousal—heart racing, anger at the imbalance.   - **Choice (1):** Punishing costs only $2 (low cost), and my undifferentiated social orientation means I’m not biased toward passive acceptance. Reducing Player 1’s earnings to $0 feels justified for their greed.   - **AC_valence (-15):** Post-punishment, valence lessens slightly (frustration eases), but residual irritation lingers (somatic symptoms: 13 vs avg 10.6).   - **AC_arousal (60):** Arousal dips after acting, but high baseline reactivity (74 vs avg 61.9) keeps adrenaline elevated.    *(Based on profile: High emotional sensitivity/intensity drives strong initial reaction; low punishment cost enables action; somatic symptoms prolong negative arousal.)*

My high emotional reactivity (total 74) intensifies frustration, amplified by low social skills (9) reducing tolerance for unfairness.   - **AA_arousal (84):** The blatant unfairness causes high emotional intensity (sub-score 26 > avg 20.99), with somatic symptoms (depression sub-score 13 > avg 10.6) manifesting as physical tension.   - **Choice (1):** Punishment cost is low ($4). My undifferentiated social orientation (no prosocial bias) and above-average individual choices (5 > avg 3.38) prioritize punishing unfairness over passive acceptance.   - **AC_valence (55):** Enforcing justice alleviates frustration. Increased positive affect stems from aligning with high observer justice sensitivity.   - **AC_arousal (76):** Residual arousal lingers due to emotional duration (sub-score 17 > avg 12.33), though satisfaction from acting mitigates peak intensity

My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32.3) and emotional intensity (26 vs. avg 21) amplify my anger.   - **AA_arousal (68):** My elevated emotional reactivity (total 74 vs. avg 62) and sensitivity (31 vs. avg 28.6) trigger strong visceral frustration—this injustice *demands* a reaction.   - **Choice (1):** Punishing costs me $0 and aligns with my prosocial leanings (4 choices vs. avg 5.15). Though socially reserved (social skills: 9 vs. avg 15.75), my moral outrage overrides passivity.   - **AC_valence (-15):** Punishing relieves some anger (emotional duration: 17 vs. avg 12.3), but residual dissatisfaction lingers—fairness wasn’t fully restored.   - **AC_arousal (41):** Arousal decreases after acting, yet my high baseline emotionality keeps it elevated. The somatic tension from depression (somatic: 13 vs. avg 10.6) eases slightly
-65	78	1	15	62	80.0	-16.0	AA_valence = -65, AA_arousal = 78, choice = 1, AC_valence = 15, AC_arousal = 62    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-65):** Strong negative emotion seeing Player 1's unfair allocation (11 vs 19). My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) intensifies anger at exploitation.   - **AA_arousal (78):** High arousal from emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61.96), especially sensitivity (31) and intensity (26) sub-scores. The blatant unfairness triggers visceral agitation.   - **Choice (1):** Punish despite cost. My autism sub-score shows strong focus on patterns/numbers (16 > avg 13.5) – 11/19 violates equitable 15/15. Low punishment cost (3$) enables acting on justice sensitivity.   - **AC_valence (15):** Mild relief after punishing. Reduced negativity from enforcing fairness (depression's somatic symptoms sub-score 13 > avg 10.6 eases slightly).   - **AC_arousal (62):** Residual adrenaline from taking action, but less volatile than initial outrage. Emotional duration sub-score (17 > avg 12.3) prolongs the arousal.    *Note: Reflects neurodivergent traits (low social skills 9, high imagination 18) and emotional reactivity shaping justice-focused response.*

10	5	0	25	-10	15.0	-15.0	AA_valence = 10, AA_arousal = 5, choice = 0, AC_valence = 25, AC_arousal = -10    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (10):** Mildly positive. The fair allocation (15/15) aligns with my strong justice sensitivity (35 > average 32), reducing immediate frustration. However, my high emotional reactivity (74 > average 61.9) and low social skills (9 < average 15.75) temper enthusiasm.   - **AA_arousal (5):** Minimal activation. The proposal is expected and non-threatening, but my emotional sensitivity (31 > 28.63) keeps slight vigilance.   - **Choice (0/Accept):** Punishing a fair split is irrational. My undifferentiated social orientation and practical cost-benefit view (losing $3 for no moral breach) outweigh fleeting impulses. High somatic symptoms (13 > 10.6) also favor conserving energy.   - **AC_valence (25):** Relief and mild satisfaction. Avoiding unnecessary conflict (low routine score: 8 < 9.41) and retaining full $10 earnings aligns with my medium depression risk profile.   - **AC_arousal (-10):** Calm decisiveness. Resolving the task without emotional escalation suits my baseline state post-decision

My high emotional sensitivity (31 vs avg 28.6) and justice sensitivity (35 vs avg 32.3) amplify my anger at this blatant unfairness.   2. **AA_arousal (85):** My elevated emotional intensity (26 vs avg 21) and somatic symptoms (13 vs avg 10.6) manifest as physical tension. The injustice feels like a visceral punch.   3. **Choice (1 - Punish):** With punishment costing $0, my moral outrage overrides hesitation. My routine subscore (8 vs avg 9.4) shows slight rigidity in expecting fairness, and punishing aligns with my justice sensitivity.   4. **AC_valence (-20):** Post-punishment, satisfaction from upholding justice tempers my anger, but residual negativity lingers due to my emotional duration score (17 vs avg 12.3).   5. **AC_arousal (45):** The action releases some tension, but my high baseline emotional reactivity (74) sustains physiological arousal at a simmer.    *[Note: Scores reflect character's profile — intense emotional reactivity, strong justice sensitivity, and lower social focus heighten negative responses to unfairness.]*

My high emotional reactivity (74 vs avg 61.96) and justice sensitivity (35 vs avg 32.33) make this near-fair split feel intentionally greedy, worsening my mood.     - *Arousal (78):* High intensity. Emotional sensitivity subscore (31 vs avg 28.63) amplifies my agitation at the unfairness.   - **Choice to punish (1):**     Low cost (pay $2) justifies punishing P1's selfishness. My low social skills (9 vs avg 15.75) reduce empathy for P1, while high imagination (18 vs avg 16.97) visualizes the justice in zeroing their earnings.   - **After punishing:**     - *Valence (69):* Positive surge. Emotional duration subscore (17 vs avg 12.33) prolongs satisfaction from enforcing fairness.     - *Arousal (65):* Residual intensity. Emotional intensity subscore (26 vs avg 20.99) sustains energy from acting on my values, despite slight guilt over aggression.    ---   *Based on traits: High baseline emotional reactivity fuels strong initial anger. Undifferentiated social orientation allows decisive punishment without prosocial/proself conflict. Low depression risk (37 vs avg 35.40) prevents choice paralysis.*

My heightened emotional intensity amplifies this slightly, but not strongly.   2. **AA_arousal (25):** The fair offer triggers moderate interest (higher baseline emotional sensitivity), but no injustice means no high activation.   3. **choice (0):** Punishing a perfectly fair split is illogical. My undifferentiated social orientation means no inherent drive to disrupt equity. Low punishment cost doesn’t justify wasting $2 on fairness.   4. **AC_valence (25):** Accepting reinforces satisfaction with a just outcome, slightly boosting positivity post-decision.   5. **AC_arousal (15):** Resolving the task calmly reduces arousal. Lingering emotional duration keeps minor engagement

My high justice sensitivity (35) makes me distrust overly "ideal" behavior, suspecting hidden motives.   - **AA_arousal (35):** Heightened alertness due to emotional intensity (subscore 26) and sensitivity (31). The fairness feels unnatural, triggering cognitive dissonance.   - **Choice (1):** Punish despite fairness. My undifferentiated social orientation (5 individual choices vs. 4 prosocial) and low routine/switching scores (7-8) drive curiosity to disrupt norms. With low punishment cost ($1), I test if Player 1’s fairness is genuine.   - **AC_valence (20):** Relief after acting on suspicion. My high imagination (18) envisions this as a "social experiment," satisfying my need to probe intentions.   - **AC_arousal (55):** Intensified adrenaline from enacting punishment. Emotional duration (17) prolongs the rush, while justice sensitivity fuels vindication.    *(Note: Scores reflect profile traits—e.g., emotional reactivity amplifying responses, imagination fueling suspicion, justice sensitivity overanalyzing fairness.)*

My high emotional sensitivity (31 vs. avg 28.6) and justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32.3) amplify my negative reaction to unfairness.   - **AA_arousal (85):** The blatant injustice causes intense visceral anger (emotional intensity subscore 26 vs. avg 21). My somatic symptoms (depression subscale 13 vs. avg 10.6) manifest as physical tension.   - **Choice (1):** Punishing costs **$0**, making it effortless to penalize greed. My justice sensitivity overrides any ambivalence (undifferentiated social orientation).   - **AC_valence (-20):** Satisfaction from punishing unfairness slightly offsets initial anger, but residual irritation lingers (emotional duration subscore 17 vs. avg 12.3).   - **AC_arousal (70):** Adrenaline from enacting justice remains high, though less volatile than initial outrage.

My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32) amplifies my anger at this imbalance.   - **AA_arousal (70):** My elevated emotional reactivity (74 vs. avg 61), especially intensity (26 vs. avg 20), spikes my adrenaline. This injustice feels physically grating.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Though punishment costs me $4, my intense aversion to unfairness (reinforced by high somatic symptoms in depression scores) overrides cost-benefit logic. Player 1 *must* be held accountable.   - **AC_valence (25):** Post-punishment, I feel grim satisfaction. Sacrificing $4 to zero Player 1’s earnings delivers moral catharsis, easing initial fury.   - **AC_arousal (60):** Residual agitation lingers (high emotional duration: 17 vs. avg 12), but the act of restoring balance dims the intensity slightly

The unfairness feels personally grating, amplified by my heightened **emotional reactivity (74 > average 61)**, causing strong visceral anger (*arousal 90*).   - **Choice (Punish):** With punishment costing **$0**, I seize the chance to enforce fairness. My **low social skills (9 < average 15)** reduce empathy for Player 1’s selfishness, while my **high pattern recognition (16 > average 13)** fixates on the numerical injustice.   - **Post-choice emotions (AC):** Punishing delivers immediate satisfaction (*valence +60*)—validating my justice sensitivity and releasing tension. Arousal drops but remains elevated (*30*) as residual anger lingers from the initial unfairness, compounded by **high emotional duration (17 > average 12)**.    ---   *Note: Scores reflect character's profile—intense justice focus, low-cost punishment, and emotional volatility driving decisive action.*

My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32.3) makes this allocation intensely frustrating, especially since 15 would be fair.   - **AA_arousal (75):** My elevated emotional reactivity (74 vs. avg 61.96) and sensitivity (31 vs. avg 28.63) spike my anger at this injustice. The imbalance triggers strong physiological arousal.   - **Choice (1):** Punishing costs only $3 (low cost), and my justice sensitivity outweighs my undifferentiated social orientation. Letting Player 1 profit $20 from unfairness feels morally unacceptable.   - **AC_valence (40):** Post-punishment, I feel relief and moral satisfaction. My somatic symptoms (13 vs. avg 10.6) ease as tension releases from rectifying the injustice.   - **AC_arousal (30):** The initial rage subsides after taking action, but residual energy remains from the emotional intensity (26 vs. avg 20.99) of confronting unfairness

My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) makes this unfairness viscerally upsetting.   - **AA_arousal (82):** Emotional intensity (26 > avg 21) and sensitivity (31 > avg 28.6) surge—my body tenses, heart races. This blatant inequality feels like a personal violation.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Paying just $1 to reduce Player 1’s earnings to $0 is an easy call. My undifferentiated social orientation means I prioritize justice over prosociality here. Their greed *should* have consequences.   - **AC_valence (-25):** Post-punishment, residual anger lingers (somatic symptoms score: 13 > avg 10.6), but satisfaction from upholding fairness softens the negativity.   - **AC_arousal (68):** Adrenaline still courses through me—emotional duration (17 > avg 12.3) prolongs the agitation—but it’s now mixed with grim resolve

My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32.3) spikes irritation (valence **-65**), and strong emotional reactivity (74 total) fuels intense frustration (arousal **72**).   - **Choice to Punish:** My undifferentiated social orientation leans individualistic (5 individual choices vs. avg 3.38), so I prioritize punishing unfairness over passive acceptance. The low cost ($3) makes punishing easy.   - **Post-Choice (AC):** Punishing restores balance—zeroing Player 1’s earnings feels satisfying. My high emotional duration sustains relief (valence **+55**), and the act amplifies my sense of control (arousal **82**).    *(Note: Scores reflect heightened emotional intensity/duration per profile, justice sensitivity, and individualistic bias.)*

My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) amplifies outrage at this unfairness.   - **AA_arousal (78):** Intense visceral reaction—heart racing, clenched jaw—fueled by high emotional reactivity (74 > avg 62.0) and sensitivity subscores (Duration 17, Intensity 26).   - **Choice (Punish):** Despite low autism societal risk, my "Numbers/Patterns" score (16 > avg 13.5) fixates on the *20:10 imbalance* as intolerable. Paying $4 to zero Player 1’s earnings feels morally necessary.   - **AC_valence (55):** Cathartic satisfaction from enforcing justice. My high "Imagination" (18 > avg 16.97) vividly pictures Player 1’s shock, sparking grim vindication.   - **AC_arousal (-30):** Tension dissolves into calm relief after acting on my values, though residual emotional sensitivity lingers.    **Personality Drivers:**   - **Undifferentiated social orientation:** Not motivated by helping Player 2, but by *punishing unfairness* (Competitive choices: 0, Individual choices: 5 > avg 3.38).   - **Depression somatic symptoms (13 > avg 10.6):** Physical tension during unfairness; relief post-punishment aligns with AC_arousal drop.    > *"Keeping $20 is greedy.

High emotional sensitivity (31) and justice sensitivity (35) amplify frustration at Player 1’s selfishness.   - **AA_arousal (68):** Intense arousal from emotional reactivity (total 74) and intensity (26). Seeing injustice triggers heightened agitation.   - **Choice (0):** Despite anger, the *high cost* of punishment ($5) conflicts with self-interest. Undifferentiated social orientation (no prosocial bias) and history of individual choices (5x) prioritize retaining $10 over punishing.   - **AC_valence (-55):** Post-acceptance valence drops further. Lingering injustice (high emotional duration:17) and somatic symptoms (depression subscore:13) fuel guilt/resignation.   - **AC_arousal (62):** Arousal remains high (emotional sensitivity:31) but dips slightly due to passive acceptance, internalizing conflict

Prior individualistic choices (5 vs avg 3.38) suggest self-driven moral enforcement.   - **AC_valence (20):** Mild relief/satisfaction from punishing unfairness, though dampened by monetary loss. Elevated imagination (18 vs avg 16.97) may enable framing punishment as symbolic justice.   - **AC_arousal (60):** Residual agitation from the confrontation, but reduced from peak due to action-taking. High emotional duration (17 vs avg 12.3) prolongs physiological arousal

My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32) magnifies this anger.   - **AA_arousal (65):** My elevated emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61) and intensity (26 > avg 20) spike my physiological response—heart racing, fists clenching.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Despite the high cost ($7), my moral outrage overrides pragmatism. Player 1’s exploitation demands consequences, aligning with my undifferentiated but justice-driven orientation.   - **AC_valence (-50):** Post-punishment, satisfaction from upholding fairness slightly tempers the anger, but residual frustration lingers (I lost $7 fighting injustice).   - **AC_arousal (85):** The act of punishing amplifies arousal—adrenaline surges from "taking a stand," worsened by my tendency for prolonged emotional duration (17 > avg 12)

My high justice sensitivity (score 35) amplifies my anger at this selfishness.   - **AA_arousal (85):** My elevated emotional reactivity (score 74) and intensity (sub-score 26) make this injustice physically agitating—heart racing, face flushed.   - **Choice (1, punish):** Despite the high cost ($9), my need to enforce fairness overrides pragmatism. My "undifferentiated" social orientation means I prioritize justice over pure self-interest or altruism here.   - **AC_valence (45):** Punishing brings relief and moral satisfaction ("They deserved it"), though the financial loss stings slightly.   - **AC_arousal (65):** Adrenaline lingers post-punishment, but the action channels my initial rage into purposeful resolve

High justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) intensifies moral outrage.   - **AA_arousal (89):** Strong physiological agitation from emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61.96), especially high emotional intensity (26 > avg 20.99).   - **Choice (1):** Punishment aligns with justice sensitivity despite high cost. Undifferentiated social orientation allows self-driven fairness enforcement.   - **AC_valence (-26):** Residual frustration from spending $5, but satisfaction from upholding justice reduces negativity moderately.   - **AC_arousal (64):** Arousal decreases post-decision (action releases tension) but remains elevated due to lingering injustice sensitivity.    *(Note: Scores reflect profile traits—high emotional reactivity amplifies initial distress, justice sensitivity drives punishment, and reduced post-choice negativity stems from cathartic fairness restoration.)*
-65	75	1	-15	55	50.0	-20.0	AA_valence = -65, AA_arousal = 75, choice = 1, AC_valence = -15, AC_arousal = 55    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-65):** Strong negative emotion triggered by perceived injustice (Player 1 keeping $16 vs. $14 for Player 2), amplified by high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3).   - **AA_arousal (75):** Intense frustration due to emotional reactivity (74 > avg 62), especially high emotional sensitivity (31) and intensity (26).   - **Choice (1):** Punishment chosen despite high cost ($6). Low social skills (9) reduce hesitation in enforcing fairness, while societal comparison (Player 2 getting $1 less than "fair" $15) fuels indignation.   - **AC_valence (-15):** Residual dissatisfaction persists (emotional duration: 17 > avg 12.3), but less severe than initial anger due to perceived justice restoration.   - **AC_arousal (55):** Arousal remains elevated (emotional intensity: 26) post-punishment, though reduced from peak fury after acting on the impulse

My high justice sensitivity appreciates the equity, though my low social skills make me less emotionally expressive about it.   - **AA_arousal (-10):** Calm but wary. The high emotional intensity/duration in my profile keeps me slightly tense, waiting for "catches," but the fairness lowers arousal.   - **choice (0):** Accepting. Punishing a fair offer feels illogical and costly ($8 loss). My "undifferentiated" social orientation means I prioritize practicality here.   - **AC_valence (35):** Clearer positivity after choosing. Resolving the decision eases my somatic anxiety (high depression somatic score), and my imagination subdimension latches onto the "correct" outcome.   - **AC_arousal (-25):** Significant calm post-decision. My high emotional duration shifts toward contentment, and the lack of conflict aligns with my low competitive choices (0 times).    *(Note: My above-average justice sensitivity (35) validates accepting fairness, while high emotional reactivity modulates intensity without overriding logic.)*

Valence is strongly negative.   - **AA_arousal (47):** High emotional reactivity (total 74 vs. avg 61.96) and sensitivity to injustice spike arousal. The blatant unfairness feels personally grating.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Despite the high cost ($9), my justice sensitivity overrides self-interest. Player 1’s greed (only $13 to Player 2) feels exploitative, and my undifferentiated social orientation means I prioritize fairness over personal gain here.   - **AC_valence (31):** Post-punishment, satisfaction from upholding justice offsets the cost. Reduced negativity as imbalance is "corrected" (Player 1 loses $17), aligning with my elevated imagination (18 vs. avg 16.97) fueling moral resolve.   - **AC_arousal (53):** Adrenaline lingers after acting decisively. Heightened emotional duration (17 vs. avg 12.33) prolongs the intensity, but now mixed with righteous relief

My low social skills (9) amplify discomfort with unfair dynamics.   - **AA_arousal (78):** Intense frustration—my high emotional reactivity (total 74 > avg 61.96) and intensity (26 > avg 20.99) fuel visceral anger. The imbalance triggers my sensitivity to injustice.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Despite the high cost ($9), my justice sensitivity and stronger-than-average emotional response override rational self-interest. I prioritize penalizing unfairness over personal gain.   - **AC_valence (-15):** Residual negativity—punishing alleviates some moral outrage, but the $9 loss and lingering injustice perception dampen relief. My somatic symptom score (13 > avg 10.6) suggests prolonged stress.   - **AC_arousal (55):** Sustained agitation—acting on emotion provides catharsis, yet high emotional duration (17 > avg 12.33) prolongs physiological arousal despite the decision being made

My elevated emotional sensitivity (31) causes moderate arousal (28).   - **Choice (0):** Punishing fairness when punishment costs $9 is irrational. My low-risk autism profile (total 58) favors logical consistency, while depression somatic symptoms (13 vs avg 10) make me avoid financial loss stress.   - **After choice (AC):** Satisfaction (valence=35) from upholding fairness without cost. Arousal drops to 12 as my high emotion duration subsides (17 vs avg 12), and imagination subscore (18) helps reframe this as a "win-win." Social behavior score (42 vs 51) confirms comfort with passive acceptance

High justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) and emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61.9) amplify outrage, causing strong physiological arousal (**85**).   - **Choice:** Punishing (**choice=1**) despite the $5 cost. Low social skills (9 < avg 15.7) reduce concern for social consequences, while high justice sensitivity demands retaliation against unfairness.   - **Post-Choice (AC):** Satisfaction from enforcing fairness boosts valence (**+40**), though arousal remains high (**70**) due to lingering anger and the $5 loss. Depression's somatic symptoms (13 > avg 10.6) may prolong physical tension.    *Note: Scores reflect heightened emotional intensity (31 sensitivity, 26 intensity) and justice-driven resolve, overriding cost considerations.*

My high emotional intensity (26 vs. 20.99 avg) and sensitivity to injustice (justice sensitivity 35 vs. 32.33 avg) make this unfairness feel viscerally negative.   - **AA_arousal (85):** My elevated emotional reactivity (total 74 vs. 61.96 avg) and sensitivity (31 vs. 28.63 avg) trigger intense arousal. The blatant inequality ($12 vs. fair $15) feels like a personal violation, igniting anger.   - **Choice (1, punish):** Despite the high cost ($7), my justice sensitivity demands action. Player 1’s greed (keeping 60% of funds) clashes with my innate need for equity, overpowering cost-benefit calculations.   - **AC_valence (20):** Punishing brings catharsis. Though I lose money, upholding fairness alleviates initial frustration, creating mild positive relief.   - **AC_arousal (60):** Residual adrenaline from enacting justice lingers, though lower than initial outrage. The act of punishing channels agitation into purposeful resolve.    *Note: Decisions reflect emotional reactivity (74) and justice sensitivity (35) driving zero-tolerance for exploitation, despite personal cost.*

My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32.3) amplifies my anger at this exploitation.   - **AA_arousal (75):** My emotional reactivity (74 vs. avg 62) spikes—shortness of breath, clenched fists—at witnessing such blatant selfishness.   - **Choice (1):** Punish. Despite the high cost ($6), my justice sensitivity overrides self-interest. Player 1 deserves consequences for gross unfairness.   - **AC_valence (40):** Satisfaction from upholding fairness outweighs the financial loss. My imagination subscore (18 vs. avg 16.97) fuels relief at "righting the wrong."   - **AC_arousal (45):** Lingering adrenaline from the confrontation, but calmer knowing injustice was challenged. Emotional duration (17 vs. avg 12.3) prolongs this resolve.    *(Note: Undifferentiated social orientation allowed contextual prioritization of justice over pure self-interest.)*
-80	85	1	35	55	115.0	-30.0	AA_valence = -80, AA_arousal = 85, choice = 1, AC_valence = 35, AC_arousal = 55    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-80):** Seeing Player 1 keep $19 while only giving $11 to Player 2 feels deeply unfair. My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32) makes this gross imbalance infuriating—it violates my innate sense of equity.   - **AA_arousal (85):** My elevated emotional reactivity (74 vs. avg 61) spikes intensely here. The unfairness triggers physical tension—heart racing, fists clenching—amplified by my high emotional intensity (26 vs. avg 20).   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** My justice sensitivity overrides the cost. Paying $6 to reduce Player 1’s earnings to $0 feels necessary to uphold fairness, especially since Player 2 has no voice. My "undifferentiated" social orientation means I prioritize punishing exploitation over personal gain.   - **AC_valence (35):** After punishing, my anger shifts to grim satisfaction. I’ve enforced justice, aligning with my values. The slight positivity comes from alleviating the initial outrage.   - **AC_arousal (55):** The intense fury lessens post-punishment, but residual adrenaline lingers (emotional duration: 17 vs. avg 12). I’m still agitated but no longer at peak intensity.    *(Note: Scores reflect profile traits—high justice sensitivity, emotional reactivity, and somatic symptoms amplify negative reactions to injustice.)*

Despite high cost ($8), the unfairness outweighs monetary loss, aligning with justice sensitivity and emotional reactivity.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Valence slightly positive (+12) from enforcing fairness, but arousal remains high (58) due to lingering intensity and somatic tension from depression sub-scores.    *(Note: Output strictly adheres to requested format based on profile-driven simulation.)*

My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. societal 32.3) and strong emotional reactivity (total 74) make this allocation intensely frustrating. My low social skills (9) might amplify this—I struggle to rationalize "near-fair" compromises.   - **AA_arousal (80):** My emotional intensity (26 vs. 20.99) and sensitivity (31 vs. 28.63) spike—I’m agitated by the blatant selfishness. The high somatic depression symptoms (13 vs. 10.6) suggest I physically feel this injustice.   - **Choice (1, punish):** Despite the high cost ($6), my justice sensitivity overrides practicality. Player 1’s greed ($17 > $15 fair share) feels exploitative. My "undifferentiated" social orientation means I prioritize punishing unfairness over self-interest here.   - **AC_valence (-20):** Post-punishment, valence less negative. Sacrificing $6 stings, but my high imagination (18) lets me visualize Player 1’s comeuppance, easing frustration. Still negative due to financial loss.   - **AC_arousal (50):** Arousal drops from peak but remains high. The act of punishing channels my intensity into "righteous" satisfaction, yet residual anger lingers from the initial unfairness. My long emotional duration (17 vs. 12.33) prolongs this state.    *(Note: Emotional dynamics align with sub-dimensions—e.g., high sensitivity/intensity fuels AA_arousal, while justice focus drives choice. Depression’s somatic symptoms amplify physical tension.)*

My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) amplifies outrage.      - *Arousal (85):* Intense surge from emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61.96), especially emotional intensity (26 > avg 20.99). Physical tension spikes (high somatic depression subscore: 13 > avg 10.6).    2. **Choice (1): Punish**      - Despite high cost ($8), punishing aligns with:        - Justice sensitivity (obsession with fairness).        - Low social skills (9 < avg 15.75): Less hesitation about conflict.        - Undifferentiated social orientation: No inherent bias toward prosocial/proself, prioritizing fairness over social harmony.    3. **Post-choice reaction (AC):**      - *Valence (-25):* Lingering anger (emotional duration: 17 > avg 12.33) but satisfaction from enforcing justice. Slight guilt over $8 loss conflicts with vindication.      - *Arousal (70):* Adrenaline still high (emotional sensitivity: 31 > avg 28.63), though reduced after action. Somatic symptoms (e.g., racing heart) persist due to depression subscore.    ---   *Note: As a human participant, my choice reflects real-time anger overriding cost-benefit analysis. Punishment delivers catharsis despite financial loss, consistent with my emotional reactivity dominating pragmatic concerns.*
5	35	0	15	20	10.0	-15.0	AA_valence = 5, AA_arousal = 35, choice = 0, AC_valence = 15, AC_arousal = 20  **Reasoning Process (as the character):**   Seeing Player 1’s perfectly fair split ($15/$15), I feel mild approval (valence +5) but also tense scrutiny (arousal +35) due to my high emotional sensitivity. The offer feels mathematically "correct," aligning with my strong affinity for patterns. However, my intense emotional reactivity amplifies my wariness—I instinctively search for hidden unfairness, but find none. Punishing costs $6, which feels disproportionately painful given my somatic sensitivity and focus on self-preservation (proself choices = 5). While my justice sensitivity is high, punishing a *fair* offer contradicts my respect for numerical equity. Accepting resolves the tension: I feel relief (valence +15) and calm (arousal +20), securing $10 without inner conflict
-28	65	1	12	41	40.0	-24.0	AA_valence = -28, AA_arousal = 65, choice = 1, AC_valence = 12, AC_arousal = 41    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-28):** Seeing Player 1 keep $16 while giving Player 2 only $14 (just $1 below fairness) feels deliberately stingy. My high justice sensitivity (35 vs. avg 32.3) amplifies frustration at this imbalance.   - **AA_arousal (65):** Strong emotional reactivity (score 74) and intensity (26 vs. avg 21) spike my irritation. The unfairness triggers visceral tension, reflected in high arousal.   - **Choice (1 - Punish):** Despite the high cost ($5), my justice sensitivity overrides pragmatism. Player 1’s choice feels exploitative, and my "undifferentiated" social orientation lacks self-preservation bias. Punishing restores moral equilibrium.   - **AC_valence (12):** Post-punishment, satisfaction from upholding fairness outweighs the monetary loss. My imagination subscore (18 vs. avg 16.97) fuels this moral resolve, easing initial negativity.   - **AC_arousal (41):** Arousal decreases slightly after acting (vs. AA_arousal 65) but remains elevated—the $5 cost and confrontation linger, yet don’t overwhelm my conviction.    *Note: Depression somatic symptoms (13 vs. avg 10.6) may subtly heighten physical tension during arousal peaks, but don’t alter the core choice.*
-65	80	1	30	60	95.0	-20.0	AA_valence = -65, AA_arousal = 80, choice = 1, AC_valence = 30, AC_arousal = 60    **Reasoning as the character:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 take $17 (clearly unfair vs. $15 fair split) triggers strong negative valence (-65) due to high justice sensitivity (35 > societal 32.3) and emotional reactivity (74 > societal 61.9). Arousal spikes to 80 from anger at the blatant injustice.   - **Choice to Punish (1):** Despite high cost ($7), punishing aligns with my intense reaction to unfairness. My autism profile (low social skills: 9 vs. 15.7) reduces empathy for Player 1’s greed, while high imagination (18 > 16.97) visualizes the ripple effects of unchecked selfishness.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Valence rises to 30 (from -65) after enforcing fairness, mixed with residual anger (arousal 60). Depression sub-scores (high somatic symptoms: 13 > 10.6) amplify physical tension, but punishing provides moral relief.    ---   *Output adheres strictly to format. Reflects character traits: justice sensitivity prioritizes fairness over cost, emotional intensity fuels decision, and undifferentiated social orientation allows detached punishment.*
-80	70	1	-40	80	40.0	10.0	AA_valence = -80, AA_arousal = 70, choice = 1, AC_valence = -40, AC_arousal = 80    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 keep $17 while giving Player 2 only $13 triggers strong frustration (high emotional reactivity score: 74). Valence is extremely negative (-80) due to perceived injustice (justice sensitivity: 35 > average). Arousal is high (70) because of intense emotional sensitivity (subscore: 31).   - **Choice:** I punish despite the high cost ($8) because:     1. My justice sensitivity demands accountability for unfairness (13 < 15).     2. My autism-related imagination subscore (18 > average) makes me hyper-focus on the ethical imbalance.     3. I prioritized fairness over self-interest (only prosocial choices: 4 times, near societal average).   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Valence improves to -40 (less negative) after enforcing justice, but residual anger lingers. Arousal spikes to 80 due to emotional intensity (subscore: 26) and somatic tension (depression somatic score: 13 > average).    ---   *Note: As a human participant, I prioritized punishing injustice despite personal cost, driven by high emotional reactivity and justice sensitivity. The lingering negativity reflects internal conflict between financial loss and moral satisfaction.*
42	28	0	58	-12	16.0	-40.0	AA_valence = 42, AA_arousal = 28, choice = 0, AC_valence = 58, AC_arousal = -12    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (42):** Seeing the fair 15/15 split triggers mild positive feelings due to my higher justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3), though dampened by low social skills (9 < avg 15.75).   - **AA_arousal (28):** Moderate engagement from emotional sensitivity (31 > avg 28.6), but not overwhelming since no injustice occurred.   - **Choice (0):** Punishing fair behavior contradicts my justice sensitivity and imagination (18 > avg 16.97), which values ideal outcomes. Paying $5 to punish fairness feels illogical.   - **AC_valence (58):** Relief and satisfaction from upholding fairness without conflict, amplified by my high emotional duration (17 > avg 12.3).   - **AC_arousal (-12):** Calmness sets in as somatic symptoms (13 > avg 10.6) ease post-decision; no lingering agitation
-45	70	1	15	55	60.0	-15.0	AA_valence = -45, AA_arousal = 70, choice = 1, AC_valence = 15, AC_arousal = 55    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotions (AA):**     - *Valence (-45):* Strong displeasure. Player 1 keeping $16 while giving $14 feels intentionally stingy, violating my high justice sensitivity (score 35 > avg 32.3).     - *Arousal (70):* Intense frustration. My emotional reactivity is high (74 > avg 61.9), especially intensity (26 > avg 20.9), making unfairness physically agitating.    - **Choice (Punish):**     - Despite the high cost ($9), punishing aligns with my undifferentiated social orientation (no self-interest bias) and extreme dislike for injustice. My low depression "interpersonal relationships" score (3 = avg) means I prioritize fairness over harmony.    - **Post-Choice Emotions (AC):**     - *Valence (15):* Mild relief/satisfaction. Sacrificing $9 stings (high emotional sensitivity: 31 > avg 28.6), but punishing the unfairness feels morally necessary.     - *Arousal (55):* Residual tension. Emotional duration (17 > avg 12.3) prolongs the agitation, though acting reduced peak intensity
-48	72	1	-12	65	36.0	-7.0	AA_valence = -48, AA_arousal = 72, choice = 1, AC_valence = -12, AC_arousal = 65    **Reasoning:**   1. **Initial Reaction (AA):**      - *Valence (-48):* Seeing Player 1 keep $18 (60%) while giving Player 2 only $12 (40%) triggers strong disapproval. My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32) makes this unfairness feel viscerally wrong.      - *Arousal (72):* Intense frustration flares up—my emotional reactivity is high (74 > avg 61), and this injustice instantly spikes my physiological response.    2. **Choice (1 = Punish):**      - Despite the high cost ($8), I refuse to tolerate exploitation. My justice sensitivity overrides cost-benefit calculations. The "prosocial" void in my profile doesn’t diminish my anger at unfairness.    3. **Post-Choice Reaction (AC):**      - *Valence (-12):* Residual anger lingers—punishing didn’t fully erase the injustice, and losing $8 stings (elevated depression somatic symptoms amplify discomfort).      - *Arousal (65):* Adrenaline still courses through me; high emotional duration (17 > avg 12) means reactions persist even after action.    ---   **Profile Drivers:**   - **Justice Sensitivity (35):** "Observer" subtype demands punishing norm violations.   - **Emotional Intensity (26):** Fuels extreme reactions to unfairness.   - **Low Social Skills (9):** Less empathy for Player 1’s greed, more focus on principle.   - **Somatic Symptoms (13):** Physical tension from anger endures post-decision
-70	75	1	30	60	100.0	-15.0	AA_valence = -70, AA_arousal = 75, choice = 1, AC_valence = 30, AC_arousal = 60    **Reasoning:**   1. **AA_valence (-70):** Seeing Player 1 keep $19 while giving only $11 to Player 2 triggers strong disapproval. My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) and emotional intensity (26 > avg 21) amplify this unfairness into visceral anger.   2. **AA_arousal (75):** The blatant inequity spikes physiological arousal—consistent with my elevated emotional reactivity (74 > avg 62). My hands tremble slightly; injustice feels physically grating.   3. **Choice (1):** Punishing despite the $5 cost. My routine subscore (8 < avg 9.4) suggests flexibility in rule enforcement, and my competitive choice count (0) reveals zero tolerance for exploitation.   4. **AC_valence (30):** Relief and grim satisfaction after punishing. Aligning with my justice sensitivity, imposing consequences converts anger into moral resolve.   5. **AC_arousal (60):** Residual adrenaline from acting against unfairness, though slightly tempered by the $5 loss. My high emotional duration (17 > avg 12.3) prolongs this activated state.    *(Note: Social behavior score (42 < avg 51.7) lowers hesitation to penalize strangers, while somatic symptoms (13 > avg 10.6) manifest as tension during the decision.)*
-80	90	1	70	85	150.0	-5.0	AA_valence = -80, AA_arousal = 90, choice = 1, AC_valence = 70, AC_arousal = 85    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-80):** Seeing Player 1 take $16 while giving Player 2 only $14 sparks intense frustration. My high emotional sensitivity (31 vs 28.6 avg) and strong justice sensitivity (35 vs 32.3 avg) make this unfairness feel like a personal violation.   - **AA_arousal (90):** My elevated emotional reactivity (74 vs 61.9 avg) and intensity (26 vs 20.9 avg) trigger physical tension—heart pounding, flushed face—at witnessing such selfishness.   - **Choice (1):** Punishing is non-negotiable. Despite the high cost ($7), my justice sensitivity and low tolerance for exploitation (coupled with below-average social skills) override financial logic. Player 1 deserves consequences.   - **AC_valence (70):** After punishing, fierce satisfaction surges. My high imagination (18 vs 16.9 avg) vividly pictures Player 1’s shock, fueling righteous vindication.   - **AC_arousal (85):** Adrenaline still courses through me—chest tight, hands slightly shaky—but now mixed with grim triumph. The lingering intensity reflects my emotional duration score (17 vs 12.3 avg).    *Note: As a 24F from Hefei with this psychological profile, I prioritize moral enforcement over money. The $3 net gain (after $7 cost) is irrelevant when injustice feels physically revolting.*
-80	75	1	-15	35	65.0	-40.0	AA_valence = -80, AA_arousal = 75, choice = 1, AC_valence = -15, AC_arousal = 35    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-80):** Seeing Player 1 keep $20 while giving only $10 to Player 2 feels deeply unfair. My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32) and emotional reactivity (74 > avg 62) amplify this frustration.   - **AA_arousal (75):** Strong visceral anger flares up due to my high emotional intensity (26 > avg 21) and sensitivity (31 > avg 29). The blatant unfairness triggers intense arousal.   - **Choice (1/Punish):** Despite the high cost ($7), I refuse to tolerate such injustice. My social behavior score (42 < avg 52) means I prioritize fairness over conformity, and my undifferentiated social orientation lacks self-preservation bias.   - **AC_valence (-15):** Paying $7 stings, but satisfaction from punishing unfairness slightly offsets the negativity. The lingering somatic symptoms from depression (13 > avg 11) amplify discomfort.   - **AC_arousal (35):** Anger dissipates after acting, but residual tension remains from emotional duration tendencies (17 > avg 12). The act of punishment provides catharsis without full calm
-40	70	1	20	65	60.0	-5.0	AA_valence = -40, AA_arousal = 70, choice = 1, AC_valence = 20, AC_arousal = 65    **Reasoning:**   - **Initial Emotion (AA):** Seeing Player 1 keep $18 (clearly unfair) sparks strong frustration (high negative valence: -40) and intense irritation (high arousal: 70), amplified by my innate emotional sensitivity and justice sensitivity (35 > average).   - **Choice (1=Punish):** Though punishing costs me $6, my justice sensitivity overrides this. Player 1’s greed feels exploitative, and my social behavior score (low: 42) means I prioritize fairness over passive acceptance.   - **Post-Choice Emotion (AC):** Punishing alleviates some frustration (valence rises to 20), but residual anger lingers (arousal stays high at 65) from the cost and Player 1’s audacity. My somatic symptoms (elevated depression sub-score) likely fuel this sustained agitation.    *(Note: Output strictly follows requested format. Values reflect character's emotional reactivity, justice sensitivity, and decision patterns.)*
-52	68	1	18	49	70.0	-19.0	AA_valence = -52, AA_arousal = 68, choice = 1, AC_valence = 18, AC_arousal = 49    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (-52):** Seeing Player 1 keep $18 while giving Player 2 only $12 feels intensely unfair. My high justice sensitivity (35 > avg 32.3) amplifies this injustice, triggering strong negative emotions.   - **AA_arousal (68):** My elevated emotional reactivity (74 > avg 61.96) and intensity (26 > avg 20.99) make this feel like a visceral, high-arousal reaction—like a spike of anger at the imbalance.   - **Choice (1 = punish):** Despite the high cost ($9), punishing aligns with my justice sensitivity. My low social skills (9 < avg 15.75) reduce hesitation about "rocking the boat," and my imaginative nature (18 > avg 16.97) frames punishment as restoring moral balance.   - **AC_valence (18):** Post-punishment, I feel a cathartic shift from negative to mildly positive valence. Taking action against unfairness eases my initial frustration, though somatic symptoms (depression subscore: 13 > avg 10.6) linger as low-level unease.   - **AC_arousal (49):** Arousal remains elevated due to emotional sensitivity (31 > avg 28.63), but punishing releases tension, lowering it from peak intensity to a simmering resolve.    *(Note: Decision reflects roleplay based on psychological profile—high justice sensitivity, emotional reactivity, and somatic symptoms overriding punishment cost.)*
5	65	0	18	42	13.0	-23.0	AA_valence = 5, AA_arousal = 65, choice = 0, AC_valence = 18, AC_arousal = 42    **Reasoning:**   - **AA_valence (slightly positive):** Seeing a perfectly fair split ($15/$15) aligns with my high justice sensitivity (score 35 vs avg 32.3), initially easing discomfort.   - **AA_arousal (high):** My heightened emotional reactivity (total 74 vs avg 61.96) spikes due to the *pressure* of the high-cost punishment dilemma ($7 fee), triggering intense internal conflict despite the fair offer.   - **Choice (accept):** Punishing fairness contradicts my justice sensitivity. My low social skills (9 vs avg 15.75) reduce desire to "send a message," and preserving $10 outweighs symbolic punishment costing me $7.   - **AC_valence (relieved):** Avoiding irrational punishment ($10 gain) resolves conflict, easing my depression-linked somatic symptoms (score 13 vs avg 10.6).   - **AC_arousal (moderate):** Residual tension lingers from my emotional intensity subdimension (26 vs avg 20.99), but the decision aligns with my numerical preference (high numbers/patterns score 16 vs avg 13.5) for logical outcomes
